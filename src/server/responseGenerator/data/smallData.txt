than the title suggests. whoops. i have to say, i'm curious about the mod-downs. is this a dupe? boring? reddit users don't like microformats? they were also asked about this during their earnings call, and the same message was repeated - that they have no plans to do an os. but it really did bring me to the opinion that paul is oblivious about his own limitations. you've managed to set a table that all bashers of paul g can admire without putting any legs under it. maybe your wisdom is obvious to the other aren't we so smartfolks in your club, but would you care to actually make an arguable statement? the same article had the following quote: carl herkstroeter, the president of the united states says. i've tested half of them. and of the number i've tested i have disqualified one pit bull because of aggressive tendencies. they have done extremely well. they have a good temperament. they are very good with children.it can even be argued that the same traits that make the pit bull so aggressive toward other dogs are what make it so nice to humans. there are a lot of pit bulls these days who are licensed therapy dogs,the writer vicki hearne points out. their stability and resoluteness make them excellent for work with people who might not like a more bouncy, flibbertigibbet sort of dog. when pit bulls set out to provide comfort, they are as resolute as they are when they fight, but what they are resolute about is being gentle. and, because they are fearless, they can be gentle with anybody. the author made an argument against the pit bull breed in the beginning of the article and then blew it apart with some of the text quoted above. his point was that pit bulls were not dangerous enough to ban, the image of the evil pit bull was just an unfounded stereotype. just like the unfounded and useless stereotypes we have about what a terrorist looks like. talk about bragging a long long time ago 130kb was a pipe dream. and people back then wrote great software. better than great! anyone on here old enough to remember the trusty old c64, or zx spectrum? yip, back then they had 48 or 64 kb, and boy did they make the most of it! some of the later 3d games were absolutely amazing! there was a fixed hardware spec that stayed constant for quite a number of years - and all learned to work around the constraints and did great things. this is the award winning paper presented by larry rosler and uri guttman at the 1999 perl conference. while 7 years old, it remains one of the most comprehensive and cogent explanations of non-trivial sorting in perl. i like this discussion, but not the article. i wonder if it would make sense to be able to rate the discussion and article separately? random numbers are not useful data unless you have a link to the source and the method by which they were obtained. the problem is not the iq, it's the potential damage of following rules and, worst, infringing the rules or looking for holes in them to get better grades and whatnot. the potential of that is creation of legions of dumb people who are supposed to rule the world. summary of the article: utorrent needs no installation, has a 100kb installable, uses 5mb memory. has low market share but been downloaded 500k times since sep 2005 launch. done by ludvig strigeus in his free time. i wonder if it takes practice to get this good at talking to people why is that ok? i wouldn't claim to be an experienced programmer just yet, but i think i have enough experience to comment. languages that are purely xare great for teaching about x. for doing real work, it's optimal to have multiple paradigms available so you can use whatever techniques map most cleanly to the problem you're working on. in the real world, it also helps to have good libraries; that's one of the main reasons perl is still as popular as it is. i like using ruby for small stuff and common lisp for big stuff. your statement about lisp also applies to ruby; it's the most expressive non-lisp language i've used. good point, but not necessarily. we could continue generating wealth faster than population growth forever and still have the above be true. that generated wealth just couldn't fall into our hands. simply put, a multi-core processor has two or more computational engines within a single processor unit. the operating system sees each as a separate cpu. both intel and amd have released dual-core processors that are showing up in systems well within the reach of the common user. it hardly matters in this case. as they say, broken clocks are right twice a day. snorting coke off hookers backsides is probably under staff training'. so no juicy details. aside from the problems already stated in other topics - okay, so, with better self-discipline you do better in school. who says school performance is something that's important in life? just about every entrepreneur i know has low discipline, high iq, and was an underachiever'. that's right. useful software could be squeezed into the c64's tape buffer, which wasn't used if one had a floppy drive. that was only 191 bytes! i am sure you will like it, at least the photos! the design patterns book only applies to oo languages - so why do people keep bringing it up when talking about functional? it's like bringing it up when you are talking about car maintenance. it's just not relevant. surely people not dying is an inherently good thing? the point when complaining about starforce is the behaviour on computers of legal customers. that's funny - i use bloglines now and was wondering if it was worth it to switch to google's aggregator. does reader not measure up somehow? cringely says google releases these to the general public just to confuse the competition. gmail would have been their biggest success that way - a simple beta service run on a shoestring, that creates enormous headaches for hotmail and yahoo. they probably confirm these goods rumors occasionally for the same reason. given the growing pains reddit is going through right now, i thought it would be a good time to haul out this classic essay. corollary: people successful in narrow fields annoy us ordinary mortals by tending to think the considerations of their field are most relevant to a given problem or decision. e.g. i don't care how many features you can pack into a lisp web server. we put the server admins through three reorgs this year, and they'll all quit if we force them to learn weird new software.and america-imitating countries here in europe. i wish articles like this would include in what context this tidbit was revealed. out of context, it sounds smug, but who knows? yes, it's a person's choice whether to die or not. but you want them to make that choice based on reality, not misguided perceptions. the article mentions that thomas joiner's dad killed himself, and the implication is that he did so under the mistaken impression that he was unwanted and unappreciated. if he'd brought that up, it may have prevented joiner's family from losing a member. i would say no, not inherently. for example, if i fall off a horse and end up like christopher reeve, well, i will be ready to go. a tutorial that shows you a very simple way how to change the color and add some cool effects to your car. this is a very good way to see how a company logo will look on a car! in one phrase: epstein and his team note that overweight and obesity is increasing in america, but their experiments do suggest one way to help kids choose healthier foods: keep them on a limited budget, and increase the price of unhealthy foods compared to healthy ones. yeah, agreed. there must be someone reading that stuff this just proves that grades in school is no measure of intelligence, but of how much you play the game. does ruby's module system not scale well? how big is big for you? free o'reilly book on asterisk available at end of entry! yeah, it's not really a race thing, even though that's how mugabe tries to portray it. he runs roughshod over everyone. every time i see an alfa romeo pass by , i lift my hat. henry ford go nabokov. i need to actually finish ulysses one of these days, too. unfortunately, some of the best books require that you know half a dozen languages in order to read them properly. as intelligence goes up, happiness goes down. look, i made a graph.i'm not sold on the effectiveness of the rankings but it's still a pretty cool experiment. nordic design blog is an interesting design industry blog. premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. - c.a.r. hoare i thought this was attributed to knuth. an absolute fantastic novel karma whoring comes to reddit only the most paranoid clients phone me in my sleep.- greg egan, quarantine i've always liked this one: the only advice i can offer, should you wake up vertiginously in a strange flat, with a thoroughly installed hangover, without any of your clothing, without any recollection of how you got there, with the police sledgehammering down the door to the accompaniment of excited dogs, while you are surrounded by bales of lavishly-produced magazines featuring children in adult acts, the only advice i can offer is to try be good-humoured and polite. - the thought gang by tibor fischer article deflating the hype surround the term web 2.0 and pointing out that actually this stuff all existed ages ago, it just works now. another excellent view of authentic eastern thought. excellent excellent! articles like this always seem to make people worry about the nationality of corporations. in 20 years, after ford and gm have been strangled by their unions and atrocious product design, there will will probably be car plants in america. they'll make kias and toyotas, be 30 owned by new york investment banks, get their raw materials from australia, etc. all of these comments are predicated on the idea that there isn't enough work to go around. that's ludicrous. work is the only thing in the world whose supply is unlimited. i enjoyed reading the financial advisor's emails. it's hard to tell what their business relationship is like: frustration? disappointment? fear? or does the guy just feel acceptance towards ellison acting like a spending nut? anyway, it's hilarious. you can't blame ellison he's got the money to spend and he earned it, but what's the deal with all the japanese stuff? an interesting perspective, but one that i disagree with completely. people are happiest when their wealth is increasing, not if it is just high. in this way they compare themselves to their past selves. even the author is unhappy because he could not walk on property that the owner previously allowed him to. he mentions that in the us, average well being has declined, but draws the wrong conclusion, which is that everyone getting wealthier is the problem. the problem is when government prevents people from earning and keeping wealth, people have no choice to compare themselves to their neighbors rather than simply looking at their own progress. and finally, the author sounds a bit like a spoiled child when he asserts that people have a right to walk on property they do not own. how about a right to drive other people's cars, or live in other people's houses when they're not at home? it's relevant in teaching new concepts, especially in the bootstrapping stage. when teaching you have to lead people on a mental journey from the known, into the unknown. that requires words. design patterns give us a rich vocabulary of words, and everyone seems to agree about what the words mean. it makes a wonderful foundation to build on. here the author is trying to explain monads, an unknown concept, to a bunch of mainstream programmers. mainstreamers these days know oo and design patterns. so starting from there is it possible to bootstrap some useful monad examples? apparently so. i have read quite a number of monad explanations, trying to get a handle on how i might understand and use monads. this one did it for me. so i applaud the author's use of vocabulary. that maybe example got me past the blank stare stage. everything here is ganked from wikipedia - what's so difficult about citing sources? great story i second that. roundabouts are the devil. i'd take waiting an extra few seconds at a light over a roundabout any day. how about letting everyone see on the comments page? your karma is 97, doesn't seem so bad ;) it was a pleasure to burn should have been a lot higher on the list. the people at google are not idiots. the last thing they would do is compete with microsoft on pc operating systems. did you even read the article? 1) at no point does it say that america is doing better than europe. 2) the first thing it points out is that the cia was not involved in this study. boo-fucking-hoo. i'm more than satisfied with each of my apple purchases. i'm also more than willing to call them on their bullshit but i'm not going to make a retrospective of all the things i got burned on because i'm a bitter whiner. duplicate. maybe triplicate, triplicate lots of good free material on drummers and drumming. trust me, you are not alone. on the plus side, his science fiction is laughably bad. old stuff. surprised it made the front page. i read this back in 1999. and here i thought the article was going to be about his embarrassing articles on intelligent design. i don't know if many people care about chess much here, but katachess is really an interesting tool to drastically improve one's chess skills that's right a japan company called web technology has released a development tool for the next generation console sony playstation 3, and even you can download a trail demo so you can try it before invest in it. .. it seems to me that the problem must be that the confiscation and subsequent redistribution was poorly managed. i cannot say i see it as a grievous historical wrong to have wealth built on slaves back be redistributed to benefit said slaves descendants at large. of course, it is better when it does not have side-effects like starvation. on a slightly different note i find the white people mentality from white people to be quite ludicrous. if someone non-caucasian can't be bothered to differentiate, oh well. but really truly do americans have much more of a cherished brotherhood with russians, danes, estonians, italians, syrians, albanians, portuguese, and georgians then they do with malaysians, koreans, japanese, kenyans, and egyptians? i define myself primarily by my ethnocultural background, and find being grouped in with white people to be on the offensive side. there are lot of specific white people i find quite distasteful and reprehensible, and a number of mostly caucasian countries whose general trends i would characterise likewise. being included with white people', i really feel, puts me in some bad company. i expect i have more meaningfully in common with quite a lot of non-caucasians than i do with hordes of caucasians not of my own ethnocultural background. so, unlike most people it seems, reading about white farmers having their land confiscated does not arouse the least bit of emotion in me. mostly because white farmers', the way i read it, really stands for well-to-do descendants of wealthy owners of african slaves'. and my ancestors going back at least a millenium, almost certainly did not own slaves of any sort, and couldn't possibly have owned african slaves due to details of history and geography. so these poor, poor white farmers are nothing like me, though i may be caucasian, and elicit no fraternal empathy from me whatsoever. sorry for the long rant but it irritates me that there seemingly was an expectation that the description would elicit an emotional response. and it irritates me that from many it does, even though the most meaningful thing they have in common with said farmers is skin-colour. this list is great. i'm especially glad that it includes the opening line of the voyage of the dawn treader. it's been my favorite opening line of a book for a very long time now. get a preview of what the market looks like in your area. browse for photos and profiles at the top three dating sites all at the same time side-by-side. so now we should learn to do threading. details and facts are of little consequence in your world-aren't they? i might have considered giving it a point, but with all the nsfw passion.com links i'm going to take away a point. funny the reason the article deserves to me modded down is that it is very short, biased and uninformative. interesting if true. there were a lot of people there. i would like to hear some sort of corroboration of her story. you're absolutely right when you comment on this use of the terminology white farmers. it is a terminology either specifically designed to spur empathy, or, at best, coming from someone who has very little respect or concern for the specific historical issues that revolve around the issue. either way, it just debases the journalist who employs such terminology. in fact, ironically, the ones who do use those terms are just agreeing with mugabe's own distorted, hypocritical and demagogic point-of-view and manipulation tactics. roundabouts are easy if you use them a lot. here in the uk they're everywhere. milton keynes, near where i live, is a new city built with a grid system of roads, and the entire thing is done with roundabouts, no traffic lights. accidents are few and far between. my work filter flagged this nsfw. i pay for my internet access. every single web page i read is hosted by a company that pays for its internet access. both ends of the transaction are paying for the privilege. here's my question - who -exactly- does att think is getting a free ride? with all the press cindy sheehan has gotten in the last year how can she say that her freedom of speech has been curtailed in any significant way? the capital police is a creation of congress yet sheehan will spin the incident as some manifestation of bush's evil empire. microsoft still thinks it can control the market by sticking to the old desktop which they own. they don't go very far in supporting formats which will enhance the browser experience. i'm not the right person to ask about ruby's module system. i use ruby for small stuff because it's easy. ruby is great for the same things people use perl and shell scripts for. it's great for quickly adding some dynamic behavior to otherwise static html - like php. lisp is not so good for these things, but if something is going to be more than a few hundred lines, i'd rather use lisp. this has more to do with the strengths of lisp than the weaknesses of ruby. knowing that a breed has a tendency to be dog-aggressive means that you can deal with it so it doesn't become a problem; neuter the dog early, expose it to lots of other dogs while it's a puppy, reprimand it immediately if it acts aggressive. most dog breeds have traits that can cause serious problems if not handled correctly. you should know what those traits are before you get a dog so you can properly train your dog. there are quite a few tools that convert dvds to files that can be viewed with ipod. among them cucusoft, xilisoft and pq dvd product. looks like some new software has been released and claims to be up to 300 faster. probably not true i believe it's also generally known that it is easier to recall something if you're in the same state that you learned it in. i wonder if this could be used to recreate useful mental states. say, remember, as best you can, a time when you were very receptive to information before you start learning, remember a time when you were relaxed to help you relax, etc. malkin: in civilized societies, if you are offended by a cartoon, you do not burn flags, take up guns and raid buildings, chant death to your opponents, or threaten suicide bombings. you write a letter to the editor.on the other hand, if you're offended by a t-shirt, you just have the person wearing it arrested, right? not that that's enough for malkin it seems like you're saying mugabe isn't so bad. what's up with that - do you have information to support? i remember fondly the hoopla she stirred up outside bush's ranch in august. it was a comedic political quandary for the administration: they couldn't frontally attack a grieving mother of a dead soldier without abandoning the visceral high-ground they cherish. she was like fox news kryptonite. unfortunately, nobody got her a political advisor, or at least a competent one, cause she started hanging out with hugo chavez. way to go, you just alienated your moderate supporters and are now left with the fringes that would have been there had you never existed. hope hugo made you feel special cindy, cause you just took a big dump on the political capital that you didn't even get to spend. funny, angry screed on lousy installers. my first impression was that this article's green-screen terminal look sucks. but the text is kind of interesting :-) the cartoon-controversy and debate on freedom of expression, today spread to the rest of europe. fewer, fewer, fewer she's been hanging with hugo chavez!? you mean the guy who is giving away free heating oil to poor people in the us? giving away free stuff like that is just wrong, obviously communist and alienates moderates! let me guess, that's why you modded it down? it's a useful, interesting resource; modding it down is a disservice to this site and to those who might not frequent other social link sites as often as you. bicycle. most efficient machine. ever. ad i'd love to see what 200m bought in woodside. how the users interact with a system is important. it should be considered a design flaw if everyone is misusing it. microsoft behind the scenes as a member of the free internet community, i call for an end to att. what optimal said. she was only asked to leave', though, not arrested. so what? who in their right mind would want to live in a country where they can be arrested for their t-shirt? such a bad choice for the name. i'll bet most people are pronouncing it you-torrent rather than utorrent'. i'll give utorrent a shot. anyone have any negative points about it? i was pronouncing it utorrent until the article pointed out that it was micro-torrent. i'm also an idiot. micro clearly makes sense. agreed. it's missing: there was no possibility of taking a walk that day from jane eyre, one of the most famous opening lines ever. i also rather like ishiguro's it seems increasingly likely that i really will undertake the expedition that has been preoccupying my imagination now for some days.from remains of the day. and saul bellow has another nice one in shortly after dawn, or what would have been dawn in a normal sky, mr. artur sammler with his bushy eye took in the books and papers of his west side bedroom and suspected strongly that they were the wrong books, the wrong papers, from the wrong planet. ugh. this is one topic that needs more serious thought and less petty politicking: if you can agree with a fascist neocon on this one you should savor it. some of these palestinians would shoot you both as soon as look at you. negative filters: go to prefs and check the box next to don't show sites after i've disliked them'. then dislike anything you don't, well, like. and it's gone. problem solved. next? ah yes zippit': seems you've already found the solution: summarize the content of the link in a comment. if you're right and reddit needs summaries, then your comments will get lots of likes. excellent. now they need to apply this technology to home carpeting, furniture upholstery and clothes. or at least mine. in this article: apps in a browser collaboration and community search and maps the new web starts here widgets break out of the browser im via the web the new web at work roll your own service good call buddy to whoever caught this article. goes in tune with the 200 billion telecom scam and the att make google et al. pay for it's traffic too!! oh i barely do any web programming. no wonder i haven't really run into ruby. :) poor, poor larry. a single tear rolls down my cheek. software lets users play videos and mp3s and offers easier access to digital images. aww, but googlecola would be based on heuristic search algorithms of what everybody else thought it should taste like, and would probably be delicious! actually, malkin never said that. besides, the post is about the danish cartoons and not about japan or wwii at all. basically, a bunch of raving lunatics with guns threatened to take hostages over a series of cartoons. malkin suggests this is insane. you suggest that to find this behaviour disturbing infers that americans don't believe anything. remember that karma on reddit is not just about posting the link before anyone else does. how well you write the headline has a lot to do with how a link gets modded. it is amazing to me that millions of people spend their money on lotteries, hoping to win when all odds are against them. if you compare lottery odds against the odds of dying it becomes incongruous to me to ever think of buying a lottery ticket again. the feds have been pushing for this for years, and it always seems to fail. i'm not quite worried yet. it not theft if exxonmobil did not force customers to buy their fuel. so how is chavez giving oil to poor us citizens any different than the us giving aid to poor people with aids in africa? there's very little difference. if it is wrong for you to rob peter to pay paul, it is wrong for uncle sam too. actually very funny, but i don't like it. it seems like stooping to his level. severely curbed? you have a strange definition of severe'. you think disallowing protests in the house gallery during a joint session with the supreme court and the president is a severe limitation to the right of free speech? insisting that the right to protest should be extended to all places and all times is less than useful. claiming that the house gallery should be available for protest without restriction is an absolutist position that seems unworkable to me. i think it's to keep non-elected folks from influencing senate work in the chambers. obviously just outside there are armies of lobbyists, but inside only the elected officials are allowed to use their freedom of speech. so my take is that sheehan gets attention for her stunt, but ultimately she knew exactly what she was doing and what the consequences would be. indeed, comrade. if only the fat cats would spend less time greedily pursuing evil profits, they could read the history books and see how great our system works. terry pratchett has some good ones that are not on the list. what's a nerd, exactly? i don't know, but anyone who asks for a precise definition of nerd clearly qualifies :) and people think that israel can negotiate with people like this. sheesh. embarrassing? looks to me like he was talking about human interaction, emotional investment, and the herd mentality, and pulled no more conclusion than there is no easy way to untangle these arguments. take your dogma for a walk, dude. ruby is good for most any kind of high-level programming, but it's been getting a lot of attention lately due to the rails web framework. ruby also has good tools for scripting on just about any os, creating guis, networking, etc. it seems more like a list of the first lines of a set of 100 books the writer liked. many lines that lots of people would like on the list are omitted, and there are also some that don't seem all that interesting or cool when looked at solely on the basis of first-line-ness. a lot of countries have a more socialist outlook than america, you'd do well to not label everything communism. your play on words are very misleading, countries constantly give things away to the unwashed masses, for example social welfare assistance, health care, education. i don't know enough about chaves to judge the man, but i see one picture of him coming from the right leaning press, and another from the left leaning press. that's to be expected. the new ps3 dark sector is a third-person shooter where players assume the role of the protagonist, a modern-day superhero, you are hayden tenno that have the availability to morph into different combat forms . indeed, politics is perception and if people see a 15 second sound bite on tv showing how chavez is giving heating oil to poor americans i think they'll have a positive perception of chavez even if they are moderates. that's why chavez doing this was so brilliant: he's helping people who have been forgotten by their own country and the even though the leaders of that country seem to have it in for him. which is why adblock is your friend. this isn't really an article; it's a advertisement for a book, disguised as an news article. a blog, a blogger and another thing :-) gosh ruby fans are sensitive indeed, china's economy has been expanding at 10 pa. for the last decade. which is irrelevant to a discussion of the efficiency of a planned economy. china is totally hybridized w.r.t. capitalism and communism. to the shining example of the chicago boys in pinochet's chile? we have the same problem where i live, we have a sudden influx of people coming from eastern europe looking for a better life. it's obvious that these immigrants are honest genuine people. it's still hard to face the uncertainty of what your neighbourhood is going to be like in 5 years. it may be the best thing that ever happened, or it may be a disaster. one thing's for certain it will be different. fewer signs, fewer accidents c'mon! yes, what reddit really needs is for a link bookmarked while using frames to not be made unusable when the submitter deletes it. it's happened to me already. i think being thrown in jail for 4 hours is severe. perhaps you'd like to try it and report back whether or not you agree. there is no prohibition against t-shirts with slogans on them. that, nitwit, is the point. the police apologized for tossing her in jail. you're completely ignoring freedom of the individual. maybe someone else would be better at making my decisions for me. however, that gives him no right to force me to submit to his will. the article is short enough not to need a distorted summary. stop it. if you have great ideas, business concepts or inventions check this site out. it was new to me this guy has an interesting model of the world. this is just the first in a series of chapters. read, think, discuss. just watch-out for the kool-aid, it's some heady stuff. physics lecture? or social commentary? only time will tell. on an entirely personal aside, i'd like to point out that i really appreciate your comments on reddit. i imagine we disagree on many of the various controversial issues, but i never feel that your comments are childish or reactionary. reddit doesn't have a space for personal communication, so i'll take this one. i'd google you, but doesn't googleable. it is a parody of all those pixel-selling sites. a team of maverick podcasters have developed technology that stitches together mp3s files on the fly, allowing listeners to create dynamic custom tailored episodes. who better to make your decisions than someone you elect? applicable. rofl doubleplusgood, citizen! don't like it? don't vote for it! i don't troll. if we disagree, we disagree. there are individuals very reverently worshiped in my country as well who, on closer examination, are far less worthy than the average person's attitude would suggest. but maybe mandela is one of the few genuine heroes of incredible virtue out there. i don't know. comrade. you mean, doubleplusgood, comrade! ;) you are right. i modded it up primarily because i think it is fostering interesting discussions. this is an update from web design world san francisco about web 2.0. finally someone discusses whether or not web 2.0 is a marketing ploy. investing thru stock markets is never a win-win strategy well if the intention was to be offensive then they get 10 out of 10. if it was to be funny then they get 7. this is from a program aired in mid-2003. i doubt that 75 of americans still believe the invasion was a good idea. if this story had any basis then there would be a class action lawsuit rather than a 20 ebook. my goodness, what a pompous windbag you'll need your hip-waders to make it through this mess. mugabe and the idiots who voted him into power got what they deserved. lets see how long it takes them to beg for food from the colonial powers. wait, i forgot, south africa will probably end up paying for everything again those who know what commodore 64 means remember awesome game called galaga. bugatron is a cool 3d remake of galaga and runs on any pc. quite cool. you guys want to take this budding little love affair offline? wild animals never kill for sport. man is the only one to whom the torture and death of his fellow creatures is amusing in itself.'- froude investing thru stock markets is never a going to be a win-win strategy there are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other.'- j. k. rowling i never saw that before, so i'm glad it was posted. it is not new, but still a very interesting short read. not much to add to this except: good call. you're absolutely right. and you can bet our representatives up on the hill stopped stuffing cash in their pockets long enough to hear them. what about all the idiots who stayed home to protest mugabe's rigging the vote? do remember that defendants are always mr, mrs, miss until convicted, however obvious their guilt and appalling their crimes. . who said standards were slipping? you've just totally mischaracterized the american south. it's not like that here. i'd say only about half the population is really unhappy about the mestizo invasion', which has been important economically regardless. and if the mass media is controlled by an elite that's hostile to the majority, that would make it a lot like plantation farming, wouldn't it? pica's point was that the southerners of long ago would not have given up. the modern day population is different, and thinks differently. the now dead southerners would not be happy at all to see how things are. the interesting thing about south africa is that the people who decided to throw in the towel are still alive. when picking best lines', there's a choice. you can either pick ones that stand well alone, or ones that are powerful in the context of the story and pretty much meaningless otherwise. a lot of these are in the second group, but kudos on the pride and prejudice opener; that's a terrific book. i approve of such frank, honest discussion of important topics, race included. i do. to many, the whole discussion thread is practically offtopic and inflammatory, including your statement. and if george washington could see new york or d.c., he'd go nuts. is there a link anywhere to the original article that got the guy fired? call of cthulhu isn't really a novel. i still modded you up tho, because it's such a great opener. i'm no fan of fox - far from it - but it was gee dub that said it first, not fox. this is one of the more mature, fair comparisons of the uses of the two languages that i have seen here. the author acknowledges that there are many factors that skew his results, so he accepts that his conclusion can only be that ruby can be a viable alternative to java and may, sometimes, be better. i may give ruby a try knowing that it has its uses in my field of software development. i wonder why it was modded down. was this a less valid contribution than any of the others? or is there just a gregg egan hater in the house. rtfa. they document how the white house started spinning it and fox fell in line. entry about steve kubby and corey maye we have always said citizen, citizen. thank you for the clarification, but the article was still interesting to me. uhhh me. there is a prohibition on protests and demonstrations on the capitol grounds. it seems that the capital police has now decided that tee-shirts are not protests as they first started. ok, they've changed their story. i'll support them either way and defer to their judgment. even so, the expulsion of sheehan and young does not cause me to worry about free speech in this country. in the gaza strip armed gunmen took over some eu offices because of a political cartoon! the newspaper in denmark that published the cartoons has received a bomb threat. arab countries have withdrawn ambassadors. which of these two situations is better evidence of intolerance of free speech? agreed, malkin at best is a half-assed version of ann cooters. it is about amazing eastern spiritual sound ie - stylised mantras there is not a real difference between protestant and catholic countries in europe, maybe 20 years ago but not so much now. a very interesting idea to create a 10,000 year clock. to build the clock, a mountain in nevada was brought and the clock build into the cliff face. i'm not a big fan of the traffic circle. you should try it in ma! you're likely to see 3 lanes of cars instead of 2 =p google stock this post is somewhat misleading now as many people are now going to think that they are in a beta channel instead of the release channel. hopefully mozilla will update their site to reflect the change. i do not understand the theft accusation. exxonmobil made a lot of money because of a natural disaster. they had a larger market share in a market that had the same demand but limited resources. i just don't get where the theftwas. guy kawasaki is a fascinating guy and all, but does every one of his blog posts need to be posted here? disk space is cheap, but disk writing time isn't, is it? i was worried that would be the trade off. but i'm guessing my bottleneck is my internet connection, not my disk speed or ram. i tried the program last night and it seems pretty good. works well, good options and it connects for a couple of torrents i was unable to with bitcomet. i'm not sure why that is, but if it works, i don't concern myself with why bitcomet failed. it does seem like i'm connecting with much fewer peers than i did with bitcomet. i probably just need to mess around with the settings. as a thought experiment, i wonder what it would be like if instead of building their own stores, companies like a starbucks franchised existing coffee houses, helping them cut costs through collective purchasing power of the franchises, helping them manage their books, etc, while still letting the franchisees maintain their own quirky style. probably not as much profit to be made that way, but would it be viable nonetheless? similar to launch.yahoo.com but it's recommendations are based on song qualities as opposed to how many people like it. leads to being much less of a popularity contest. it's become my main method of discovering new music. next to www.pandora.com i think launch is the best system out there for discovering new music. people always focus on it's online selection of music but the real beauty of yahoo music is helping you discover new music. how do i read ppt files? very carefully. thanks. you're welcome. if you really want to though, you can get a powerpoint viewer for free off microsoft's site. www.last.fm rules them all! wow, looks like it sucks less. somehow i imagine that wasn't difficult. my miata can reach speeds significantly higher than is usually safe. it does so in response to user input, in a fairly predictable way. perhaps i should sue mazda. another music recommendation site in the same vein as yahoo launch and pandora. probably more similar to yahoo then pandora. domestic spying is as loaded a term as terrorist surveillance. if you're going to bash someone, can't you choose some better wording for your title. i don't like when i see my allies in this surveillance without warrant argument botching it so badly. javascript is often looked down on for how it is commonly used instead of being evaluated on its merits as a language. the more i play with it the more i realize how wrong i was in treating it as a piece of junk. anyone know where you can find a copy of the complete list? i tried google, but with no luck. we all know by now that you can't believe a thing he says. the way to get the best decisions made about running the british railway system is to put you in charge? kids would rather be the way they came into the world: naked. and as they adapt to the world of clothing, extra layers - particularly coats - add to their heightened perception of constriction. it feels like they're being really tightly bound, and it feels bad, i disagree. please tell me prez. w isn't this stupid! please? is what chuck norris exclaims prior to roundhouse kicking you in the head. db has become a millionaire because of newspapers. he thinks that they are finished. he may well be right. you don't see bush driving himself around in a beat-up ford tempo because millions of americans are too poor to afford health insurance. free version? downvoted due to the obnoxious back-button-breaking redirect, not the content. did anybody think to cache this? coral isn't working, and the site appears to be down. easy tutorial on how to add album art to you songs. chill out guys it's just a cool political simulation game that lets you recreate 2004 election. have we met before? on digg perhaps? fringe speculation - vince foster was murdered redux they have absolutely no taste and i don't mean that in a small way- steve jobs hmmm thanks, borga, for making reddit just like slashdot. that's a great contribution to mankind, too. hilarious just plain funny. these shot glasses are faithful reproductions of a winchester 12-gauge shell, terrific for a collection or for actual double-barrel enjoyment! yeah, it's ok. i told you so, the site sells cheap downloadable software. do they explain anything about the ton of bugs? you could just, y'know, not post comments dissing every article posted here. or, i dunno, make a point every now and then or something. all the people you listed have a style that makes their writings often come off as the absolute truth, true. as a critical thinker, however, it is your job to filter out any biases and extract any useful information and insights. is that too much to ask? i'm using this instead of firefox. it's just cleaner in my opinion. there's less in the way. plus ie just renders faster. wasn't 4k basic written on an altair emulator running on a harvard pdp-10 running tops-10 which students did not have permission to use for commercial work? gates was already a hypocrite 30 years ago. yes, that is a bit disturbing. i propose we go along with robert anton wilson's naming scheme, and give all kuiper objects disney names. so we've got pluto, ub313 could be mickey, and the next one we find would of course be goofy. no, i don't think so, why? i also have problems with what bush has done but. the title of the article is the white house memo'. the article goes on to say: channel 4 news has seen minutes from that meeting..'. what is this memo? what are these minutes? the rest of the article just quotes a book by someone who was not at the supposed meeting, nor are there any claims that the author saw any memos or minutes. openoffice.org has a freebsd version, and handles the .ppt quite well enough. open it with the impresspiece of oo.o, and then press f5 to fullscreen. left-click for next page, right-click for previous. note to myself - play with erlang's sdl interface! oooooooooold all illegal aliens are undocumented workers. these sets are equivalent. all people put under nsa surveillance are not terrorists. only a tiny fraction are. these sets are not equivalent. so, logically speaking, terrorist surveillance is not equivalent to nsa surveillance better headline makes all the difference although we should have caught the dupe in the first place. not bad, not bad at all i myself bemoan the level of screechy headedness that permeates american politics, but i'm going to have to disagree with you. when someone illegally puts me under surveillance, they are -spying- on me. yep actually i submitted this with a similar headline a while ago, it kept getting dislikes so i deleted it. i guess i shouldn't have given up so easily. and that's the art of maintaining code that wasn't written by you. suppressing the urge to run away or change everything. i have to maintain code in two languages i wouldn't have chosen for these projects. one choice was a bit of a design failure, too. but it works. and money can be made with it. the title says it all so is this available in the us? it's not free, you've got to buy it no, chucknorrisfacts.com has a pretty face and wants to sell you crappy stuff. ;) this could be an interesting development. i agree with him this wasted my time, because i didn't notice the article was out of date. also, it's easier to look at about:config than to go editing .js files jeez. so what's the website address? i'm actually not complaining. i'm just not sure how i like that. and i figure if anyone else tries to submit the article they will end up here. sorry if i ruined a great article but this is pretty big news not something you won't see elsewhere i really needed a good laugh today. google is your friend. cell phone tracking turned up several likely-looking candidates, though that's not to say he used one of those. make sure you have the google toolbar installed big brother is watching you and soon everyone else will too, it seems. what a bizarre and interesting article, but why are the articles in this magazine so long now that's sneaky: posting an article on reddit that on its turn links to a list paul graham and guy kawasaki articles hmmm great title you've for that website - i would like it enriched with daily news ;-) who are paul graham and guy kawasaki? do these names often come up here? it is sickening what the west is doing under the guise of democracy and freedom'. the cartoon is clearly offensive to peoples and should be apologized for. online books, articles and audio etc. from noam chomsky. it's even easier to track someone's phone than he makes out in the article. you don't even need physical access to a person's phone. if all that person has to do is reply with locator some other canned response, then all someone has to do is use a prank text message provider which allow you to send sms messages which appear to come from any number you set. obviously that person will still receive the original messages from the tracking service, but most of them will probably think it's spam. virgin in the uk are the only network not providing tracking data to companies like this. scary stuff. a cool news site your work treats you like a two year old. what are the languages? i don't want to bother. wow, how cool is that!!!! i'd never heard of sawstop before. the videos on their website are amazing! rotflol :) hey! these guys are ripping off - oh, yeah, jeff beat me to that post. remember you're theoretically writing this to the smartest, busiest person you know,that's not a theory in my case. i actually don't know anybody. if i manage to do anything real with common lisp one day, consider his point proven. until that day, the jury is out. i would guess that congress might be upset about so much of our nations bandwidth running through a single provider. also there might be some lobbying by cable tv to try and stave off the growth of iptv. personally i think that as long as demand for more bandwidth exists someone will find a way. short term this might cause some growing pains, but long term verizon will either put up more bandwidth or increase the amount publicly available. that and someone else could fill the space as well. exactly what i thought. i used to work at a subway as a teen. what exactly is so beautiful as a package wrapped like a sandwich? they must not eat subs in japan. democracy is more than just elections. next time i'm using a sausage as a push stick, i can rest assured that the sausage is still edible afterwords. this has been a major issue in my workshop. lots of brats shredded by table saw accidents. if they're so convinced it works, let's see the inventors fingers and not a cheap hotdog. flattery gets you nowhere, pandering on the other hand i think borga has a point here. looking at ie or exchange, it's honestly hard to believe anyone at microsoft uses their own software. even the old netscape still rendered pages faster than ie. exchange always was and is still rubbish! functional languages. careful that also makes you the dumbest, laziest person you know. morality is relative. there are certain things that you would surely find offensive, that i won't attempt to name. i'm not going to defend the controversy around the cartoons, because to me they're just cartoons and i don't care about them or wealth. but if you're suggesting that there are no grounds to being offended perhaps you need to revisit your own views of morality and see if there isn't anything that is, or could be, offensive to you. as it stands, i am hearing your argument as i am normal'. what is taking something too far for you is not ok, what is not that someone else thinks is, has no grounds. you are not normal, or at least are not the measuring device from which to judge the justification for everyone else's sense of right and wrong from. paul graham has an interesting piece of writing titled what you can't say', where he discusses the taboos we have in western society now, and how in the future we might find those taboos ridiculous censoring. the ideas that are getting the most votes are tech related according to your statement, if i observe that the situation is far, far, far worse outside the us then i have no principles or morals because i made that comparison? not at all, you used that comparison to make the point that the us was tolerant of free speech. this is a bogus argument imo and it could be used to justify almost anything. you may not find it worrying that somebody is arrested for having a statistic printed on her shirt, but to me it's the sort of thing we would criticise in a country like north korea. the fact is that the us is seen increasingly as a threat by the rest of the world, partly due to these kinds of incident. that analogy is incorrect. the situation is closer to this: you and i agree that the string of written characters five represents the number of fingers on a normal human hand, but i think it is pronounced friv', while you think it is pronounced sank'. wasn't st. john of danforth clarence thomas's sponsor? not that i care, but for the washington post, the gop center is the girl that would be medium hot if only she'd shave her legs lose the ugly glasses for some contacts. what ms. gop center doesn't know is that there is a far hotter babe, sometimes ms. democratic leadership conference, sometimes somebody left of her, and that mr. washington post will drop ms. gc like a brick if the hotter babe is available. kind of a cruel game, and one that deserves to be made into a screenplay by neil labute, but amusing in its way. good government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern. the machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery. the most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders. i feel that has quite a point, since past elections the demo part of democracy is hard pressed to have much more effect. oh, and i would feel very nerdy quoting that, but i haven't read it:) the second link is from june 2003, the first one seems legit. i notice death by choking on ham sandwich isn't included in the summary of causes of death feynman's own account of this is much longer, and one of his most excellent stories. you can find it in what do you care about what other people think?which is his second collection of anecdotes. the languages haven't been written yet. but we do have lots of good concepts which have been tested in languages like haskell and ml, which could really help game development scale better. functional programming is especially useful when dealing with parallelism, and that's one of the big things tim sweeney is after. sorry about that :-, being good is a wealth of peace amongst progressive peoples. how many they number i don't know. i can't blame them for not wishing to speak out too loudly. amongst the rest, being good is a wealth of peace in the sense of peace as submission to allah and to being goodic law, for believers that is, and dhimmitude for non-believers. so, yes, peace is misleading in the liberal, western notion of that word. i think we ought to stop using the expression wealth of peace with respect to being good. what else did you think it would save? i reckon there should be some kind of malkovich malkovich malkovich thing when you vote for reddit itself. seriously? since 1990? maybe i'm just completely uneducated on the subject. all i've been able to find on the subject is anti-libertarian, and i haven't been able to find any libertarian perspectives on chile after 1995 or so. no thanks. good analysis and realistic too. what you're saying is true, but my concern isn't with nationality of corporations. my concern is with class and property. if rich people do a good job of owning everything, median living standards could fall while net-human-wealth increases. we could be stuck with what a pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperity while 1 of the population controls the wealth. got all that. and i know what a pitbull looks like. there are people who couldn't tell a long hair chihuahua from a cocker spaniel. whatever. i don't see how a) relates to this topic. with b) you are right, but why is python more random than java? there are examples even for haskell used in successful businesses. so the point would be to standardize on the right platform, because if you and your competitor get the standardized-platform bonus, but you get some microsavings as well that's one point for you. update: see the guys in question missed out by a handful of runs but at least they have an equal chance of getting bank loans. yes, i'm joking. glad to know that happens to other people too - the figuring out what you're asking as you write the question in an email thing that is. does anyone else see the irony of that letter when you read it in context with the open source movement? no wonder linux caught him off guard - even 30 years ago he could not imagine giving software away for free and just look how disastrous that decision turned out for himi bet you he kicks himself about it every single day! true, that's why i posted it :d is there anything wrong with that? the title is quite misleading here. usa is seen second most negative from a selection of only nine countries; it's not like it were seen second most evil among the fifty biggest countries. interesting article, though. nice old article on portability - guru style :) hice cue graham's essay on writing essays. dude, cut it out with the ugly spamming. go buy google adwords like everybody else does. the book is from 1992. that predates the street lingo use of hater. simplistic enough to be inane'? one of the most infuriating things in software dev today? thoughtless meritocracy. hire the smartest 10.'if they're not real hackers, don't let them in the building.'if you don't understand closures, you're not a real programmer. what happens to the less smart 90 you don't hire? billions of lines of code are written every year by developers who are just about good enough, who produce software that's just about good enough, that just about does the job. so maybe they should be better. then we need to work to help to make them better, not write them off as unworthy mortals. i can think of half a dozen folk i've worked with who produce good-enough but shabby internal production apps who'd benefit from the rather basic advice in the irish dev network article. a real programmer is someone who writes programs that are really used'. we'd do ourselves a lot of favours by not using it to mean exceptional coder', master craftsman', senior dev', guru in the making really good analysis yeah, maybe the journalist's girlfriend never received a notification? you're right, except that they're both legit i was trying to show that the  had not changed in 2.5 years. i guess between 55-60 of americans watch fox news they're in good democratic company there: iran, china, cuba, pakistan, russia, sudan 1. people were offended, so the paper apologised. they didn't self-censor. apology != self-censorship. 2. the jyllands posten had a perfect right to publish the cartoons. offended peoples had a perfect right to boycott danish goods. 3. other major papers, it seems, are cowering out of fear of triggering a boycott and endangering the profits of gummy bears and german coffee filters in arabic countries.possibly; but possibly they're not printing the cartoons because they're not especially good or funny. a third of the emails i write i never send. it helps my thought process to have written it, but after leaving it open on my desktop for 30 minutes, i'll decide that it's either trivial, or should be said in person. small world i went to high school with that guy i've inadvertently done this many times. when i don't have time to figure something out at home, i'll email the problem to myself at work, or vice versa. it's amazing how different the problem seems when you read it the next day. all owners of purebred dogs can help fight cancer in dogs and in people! mologogo, alas, only works on the nextel network. it's funny how the whole article looks at how things are different now but doesn't talk much about how the changes are also making things worse. we may be making more money as a nation but the wealth divide is growing. i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing as long as people aren't starving but the home ownership numbers are going up even as median wages after inflation are headed down. the question is whether or not the unravelling housing bubble will take the rest of the economy with it. some comments are quite insightful. last.fm is very cool. install the plugin for your favourite audio player and it auto-updates your listening profile, then starts making recommendations. very cool. don't let school get in the way of your education. dad and son talking about internet in the year 2019 the question is. why??? the author seems to be up in arms rather about the secrets and not the successful'. this is fair game i think. that's the truth. we need to reclaim science from the dirty scientists and put it back in the hands of politicians. that's the only sane thing to do. they're the new tom peters, only less charismatic. megite is the newspaper for anyone interested in what's happening right now by intelligently uncovering the most relevant items from thousands of news sites and weblogs. hello captain obvious have you got a source for this? not that i have any particular reason to disbelieve you, but this obviously completely undermines the article, so it's a pretty major claim. you can have it both ways. in the us, the government props up the defense, oil, pharmaceutical, and technology industries. who do you think ad, gd, microsoft et al's biggest customers are? who do you think began the internet? pretending the us is a free market is a hilarious joke. edit: no it's actually not funny. it's just sad that anyone believes in it. thanks for the pointer - the game is very cool mine resembles a scraggly serpent of death what the founding fathers always intended. and when you work in a single-language company you are not allowed to choose another language for a new project. someone asked why google even used java at all? greg appeared to bite his tongue and then said that there are a lot of good java programmers out there and google hires a few of them. an attitude some of the more .. uh .. impassioned folks around here should observe. i wonder how long the author and his fan club will remain married. this essay reminded me of the works by professors, past their prime, overanalyzing the mundane to create themselves some work so as not to feel too useless while waiting to think their next great thought. and the government is growing faster than ever. big government is incompatible with a healthy economy, and it's just going to get worse. interesting read discussing the various advertisers and their goals for their 2.5m ads during the super bowl. also interesting to read what abc and the nfl do not want on the air, and who is trying to push the line. i like the colors he doesn't lean towards erlang. he specifically says he needs descriptive error messages. :d the disappearing one? maybe they're counting the bullets too. overview of how yahoo and google's core businesses work. he seemed to do okay in the software business in the end. yeah, and the great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from. don't forget about all the dead standards', too. it's one thing to bless and rubber stamp some obscure specification as standard'. it's quite another thing for it to be effectively standard by the familiar concept of the adjective, that is, widely accepted, deployed, and understood. yet another one to the list of obvious-things-anyone-should-do. i am waiting to the blog post that says smart people shower, smart people breath, etc. maybe not, but i think the essential point was that we need a plain speaker who can present some unpleasant truths to people in an understandable way. bandwidth limit exceeded there's something like a billion and a half peoples in the world. that's a quarter of everyone there is. from a quick look at the census figures, 14 of the population in russia are people; 13 in india, 10 in france, 3 in the uk, 1.5 in america. are you really saying the majority of this enormous number of people are threatening unbelievers and encouraging suicide bombing? i can't believe this. i'm at a loss for words. well, this is one american who is saying, support denmark - buy danish!of course, the industry, forever the idiots, have been lobbying apple to raise its prices at the itunes store and even want a slice of ipod revenues. the ridiculousness of this request cannot be overstated. this is because the music industry is used to be treated like babies. i don't know about in the usa, but in canada the record companies get a cut everytime a blank tape is sold. does being offended give the offender's license to abduct, threaten and attempt to injure or kill? because in case you haven't been following the stories too closely, that's exactly what people are doing. boycotts, apologies, ok fine. but there are people out there who are looking to kill any random dane they find because of the weak association of sharing a nation with the paper that published these cartoons. like most extremism, it's the most specious of reasoning justifying the most heinous of reactions. so i guess fascism and communism are ok, because totalitarianism can't be held responsible for the people who actually implement it. false analogy. most fascist and communists regimes are oppressive and unpleasant. most peoples aren't suicide bombers. otherwise there'd be a lot fewer tall buildings and a lot more holes in the ground. i'll mirror and resubmit if it doesn't sort itself out tonight. from the picture on the guy's website i think he is the sad-loner type. maybe the us state dept will apologize to bin laden for the construction of the wtc. yet many people don't do this, unfortunately. here's another. this is just bizarre. i find the u.s. stance on this repugnant. i'm at a loss. this is the sort of free speech that is or rather was a pillar of liberty for the nation. what has happened to us? every government is a parliament of whores. the trouble is, in a democracy, the whores are us. - pj o'rourke this'll be a nice one for the evolutionists to explain =) but in canada the record companies get a cut everytime a blank tape is sold are you serious? can you verify with a link? - canadian in toronto perhaps the author of the article should take a good long look in the mirror and then realise that he is the dolt. we all know kangaroos are pretty special, but it's their lack of flatulence, or more precisely the lack of methane emissions, that has researchers excited.there's some content, if you can get over the snarky tone. which is a bit hard to do. my irony meter went off the charts where he said that the original tips were simplistic, then for his own personal top 7 tips for being a successful programmer, he says learn how to program well'. ah, gotcha. i was going to include the blank cds, but the links you posted explain everything. smarter people may ask questions, but i seem to remember the idiots that ask questions more easily. this woman i work with - my boss handed her a self-evaluation. boss said, complete this so we can discuss it during your appraisal.after about five minutes, the coworker asks, so who is supposed to fill out this evaluation? can anyone do it? i said, here. you give it to me. i'll fill out your self-eval. are you kidding me? she got promoted. or you could just unsubscribe from the service, given that, as kam0 pointed out above, it's a legitimate, straight-laced service which has been set up with combatting stalkers in mind. cheers for that. never doubted you for a second :). it's ridiculous that such a well-respected publication can get away with publishing this bullshit. i'm voting this down, for what little good it may do. it's only karma. i know the frustration, but it's not a big deal in the scheme of things. and i think displaying the exact ratings on both submissions and comments is one of reddit's best aspects. sites which hide what's going on from the user in the name of simplicity or usability or something are making a big mistake; in my view, the more information, the better. plus i quite like the idea that people are rewarded as much for coming up with an interesting title as they are for finding a worthwhile link. i mean, if your link is good enough, it will be voted up anyway, but a title can really help an otherwise decent, but not brilliant, link to get votes. it's kind've like charisma in real life. mobiles don't have dial tones. turing did start seeing a jungian analyst and developed a taste for tolstoy, but neither is an infallible sign of madness. priceless :) i would say that they sympathize with those notions. when you have people singing pop music about killing jews and children being taught by their elders the osama bin laden is a hero and that if you die while killing infidels you'll get 72 virgins when you go to heaven, then you are seeing a culture of hate and death. why is it that thousands of people will show up to a town square to scream for the death of americans because someone put a koran in a toilet? i'm sure that there have been people who've torn off pages of the new testament and used them to wipe their bottoms, but jerry falwell doesn't go on tv and tell his followers to kill them. we are dealing with a culture in which the agenda is being set by bloody-minded perverts who can count on the ignorance and bigotry of their followers. that is why i can say with absolute confidence that the majority of this enormous number of people are threatening unbelievers and encouraging suicide bombing'. that map gesture is pretty hot. it's not bad, but that's nothing to do with the score of my comments or the score of articles recommended for me. so this is another thing that both evolution theory and intelligent design theory is trying to say proves their point? how annoying. going to another point, id can be taught in schools as soon as they bring in some compelling evidence. the theory of evolution already has some good scientific support. countdown to the denial 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 i'll give it a try. the wasp evolved this behavior in order to ensure easier reproduction. it was probably a cockroach eating wasp that already went for the head to kill quickly. then by a freak accident a wasp was genetically predisposed to zombifying and then laying eggs inside the roach. then later on the behavior evolved where the wasp's offspring would have a better chance of survival if the wasp managed to control where the roach went to avoid predators. over time, predators killed all the population of that type of wasps without that behavior and voila. all your base are belong to ushas already gone through several cycles of being meta-ironically hip. and? the best blog of pixel sites. the wisdom of parasites'. sorta like the wisdom of crowds? el peor blog, quieres decir. the article linked to does not make the claim that unix is a programming language. this is incorrect, misleading, and sensational. cue graham's essay on writing essays. inspired by that, i have been writing an essay on writing an essay on writing essays. unfortunately, i haven't figured out what the base case is, so i can't seem to finish. it's all so very existential. we already knew this.. would be awesome if it had useful information instead of being a big advertisement for what is essentially note taking software. yeah, i was about to say the same thing the blog is a permalink, but the blog post itself has no permalink. future readers will have to dig through the archive to find the article. i am pretty sure we could just make it implicit that learn how to do x wellis a good tip for all cases of x. the officer corps is also being hollowed out, as younger officers quit in such numbers that 100 percent of those remaining are automatically moved up the ladder. for example, last year the army promoted 97 percent of all eligible captains, up from as historical average of 70 percent to 80 percent. that's worries me: the peter principle meets an organization with a half-trillion dollar budget and lots of guns. like lottery players? :-d the he is me. does anyone have the full text of the state department's comments? alright, that's it. we are detaining all peoples until we can somehow expel them, via a constitutional amendment if necessary, i have some questions about this. can you tell who is a people by looking at them? can you tell who is a people by dna-testing them? if a people rejected their wealth, in this ethnic cleansing scenario, would she be released from the camps? if a people wore a green star and agreed to have all his communications monitored, would he be released from the camps? would children of people parents also be interned in the detention camps, or would they be separated from their parents? would you have to be a practising people, or would coming from an arab-american family and attending mosque occasionally do? if you think the majority of americans would be in favour of a policy of mass detention without trial and religious persecution - would you describe their opinion as completely bugfuck'? when you have people singing pop music about killing jews and children being taught by their elders the osama bin laden is a hero and that if you die while killing infidels you'll get 72 virgins when you go to heaven, then you are seeing a culture of hate and death. i think you're describing palestine and iran - highly publicised and exceptional cases in the middle east. you may be aware that less than 20 of peoples live in the middle east. these pathologies aren't exactly common in russia, india, france or the uk. i can say with absolute confidence that the majority of this enormous number of people are threatening unbelievers and encouraging suicide bombing'. could you give some evidence that the majority of peoples in countries outside the middle east - the other 80 - are doing this? it doesn't work for states with a single, at-large, representative like wyoming, montana, north or south dakota. it's more likely to be iwillteachyourpenistobebigger.com. really great stuff here. not the usual google videos up here. happytheman says: these pathologies aren't exactly common in russia, india, france or the uk. russia: beslan india: kashmir france: paris riots uk: july 7th subway bombings so what is your point? what a lot of alarmist nonsense. also fails where there is a meandering natural border. who needs more than 640kb anyway? nice pictures, the only problem is that they show how old i am. that's one company, and do they do it because they are legally obliged or because they want to so to appear non-evil? yes, it states it's a legal thing, but i wonder how strict each country is this way, and how violable it is in practice. probably nothing to worry about, though. a speculative look at psychology professor seth roberts as yet unreleased shangri-la diet, which is said to promote weight loss through the consumption of canola oil and a dilute sugar water solution. coming to this space: comments on the importance of picking a good headline. some of these are so prevalent in comment pages, you could almost call the post a duplicate. whoah! she's hot. wow, i think they flew in captain obvious himself to write that article. i'm waiting for an article about water being wet to mod up. i think i see a nipple there. some earlier attempts today tried to do just that. corante couldn't handle the load and boing boing could. if you could create anything you wanted, why not? i wonder what the policy on racist or sexist cartoons are for american newspapers? these things are not illegal nor should be, or are called for to be, but people seem to whine as if they were. they were, however, in bad taste by just portraying negatively and having no point in the process. the paper was probably right in saying okay, that was a little much, sorry about that and this state department was probably right in saying yeah, that was disrespectful without any point. because it was, and that's most of the point. by not making a point it becomes a thing indicating prejudice, not criticism. even caricaturing stupid stereotypes. it's not directly related freedom of the press, freedom of speech, nor suppression of truth. this is the funnies section, mild conjecture at best and inherently simplification - sort of risky in any case. it is not a report of an event that is under threat of having its truth suppressed, and no one threatened the danish to stop this or -bloody-else. at least, we call for tolerance does not sound like that to me - but apparently it does to some. maybe they should have been ignored, condemned. yes, the response was over the top, but that's how offense can work - perhaps how it usually does work. shiva, not shakti. there is a large difference: that was meant in fairly good faith, as constructive criticism mixed with some deconstruction of some ideas that probably deserve a good looking at, -and obviously humour. it's done in relatively good taste. so is, for example, dogma, which pokes plenty of fun at christianity, but does so with fair respect and clearly more knowledge of what it is criticising that most viewers have, and doesn't caricature much beyond the need of condensation into actual characters. the cartoon has just faith that it wouldn't stir up a shitstorm. not necessarily bad, but it's hardly comparable in any way. yes. i realized it shortly after i posted. i'd fix it if i could. sorry. ahh the old dark fiber rumor i skimmed the article. i guess i'm one of the unlucky ones who's too busy with work to read that article at least right now. not that google didn't make any concessions. however, a slightly restricted google is better than no google at all. what's the name of the song playing in the background? i had it stuck in my head a few months ago. novell has been polling the public for the last month to find out what windows-only applications, if ported to linux, would increase the likelihood that people would switch to linux. more than 10,000 votes have been counted since the first week of january. i agree. the marketing is often just sniping. of course he has to do what he has to do, but it comes across as testosterone laden aggression. and we wonder why there are few females in this profession. i bet they would carry on about things like this. hey the pre-trial hearing is set for february 15th. if i had to guess and that's really all i can do i'd guess that this sentence from the news account is the key to understanding the situation: prosecutors and kubby's attorneys are reportedly trying to work out a plea agreement that will allow kubby to serve his sentence at home.true, if you are a technologist it's the virgin mary! sell it to golden palace! why not five sigmas? seven? ridiculous and unreal marketing term, nothing more. what makes americans great is that they have the freedom to fail'. notepad being used to take notes :). i thought it had always been the poor man's emacs capitalism is defined as: 1. exploration of wealth 2. accumulation of wealth distribution of wealth is implicitly built in 1 2 steps. socialism is defined as: 1. distribution of wealth exploration and accumulation of wealth is implicitly built in 1. guess that proves the theory that average faces look prettier. i wonder what the first java programmers had to do when trying to use java at work. when i think of the first java code and examples i've seen on the net, i don't picture these programmers as mavericks. more like little children trying their sinus scrollers with a different language. tell us something we didn't know. yeah, right. i once worked for a company where the boss switched the development to java and xml because it was cool. one student who helped with some projects in the past had told him so every programmer can pick up common lisp despite the many texts that say only demigods should use it. what argument is left? still the task at hand thing? i haven't described any circumstances for such decisions or what the company is like i work for. do you know if i even have peers in programming? the guy is obviously very smart. but i would not consider acting arrogantly in an interview hilarious. i think they are all redheads that's so awful! the only nice thing about it is that there's one less roach in the world there was that one reddit post from a long time ago about that one guy who had like 1 million contacts in the contact database who would do lunch like 4 times a day and had aspirations of gearing his life around potentially meeting donald trump someday. now that's schmoozing. oh. well, that explains it, then. puffer fish vs otter is interesting as well and tomorrow google opens chain of free hospitals operated by google robots and powered by google environmentally friendly nuclear fusion plants. sigh, gmail just doesn't thrill me like it used to. 4 star deluxe hotel near oxford street, marble arch, business services for corporate travellers in a democracy, what the majority wants is what everybody gets no, that's populism, something practised by mussolini. a bit like a blog to me. interesting. unfortunately for id people, no one has been able to demonstrate that something was irreducibly complex. i don't see how could prove such a thing. attempts so far have basically just been appeals to common sense, which is not a good basis for science. this doesn't bother id people too much though since the they are not advancing a scientific explanation anyway. que? the intended audience has a brain. i also threw out my tv in 1995. believe me people, you don't need it. nowadays you don't even need it to watch movies. go rent a dvd and put it into the computer instead. the reason i threw out my tv was that i was a total tv addict. i could spend endless hours vegetating in front of the tv. now i spend my time reading, listening to music, programming and what-have-you. i can really recommend it! you can't have it both ways. on the contrary, you have to have it both ways. if the government makes pro people publicity stunts like this they get more room to manoeuvre when invading people countries. it makes it slightly harder for the cries of this is a war against being good to stick. following the success of google adwords,google toolbar, gmail and google talk, today google announced its unique new product google speak'. has this man really developed the third eye', as known in buddhism, myth and wealth. will it for food well written asking questions is an obvious thing that many smart people fail to do, but something his article did not go into more depth about is why smart people don't ask questions. this is a problem in our educational system: we are taught to know the right answer and not to think our way to the solution. there was an article a couple days ago about a teacher using the socratic method to teach students binary math. i believe we could become much more productive as a society if our children were introduced to subjects by asking thoughtful questions that lead their minds in the correct direction for the topic. i haven't watched tv for a long time, because everything what they spit out is pretty useful and annoying. buy this and buy that.. blah i've read one article about brains and how they act when you watch tv.. they're passive compared to situation when you're reading something. funny isn't it. this is getting pretty scary. huge network in one hands. skynet!!! me, too. i still watch about two hours a week, when those shows are on and if i don't forget. one of the most pernicious effects of the television, in my humble opinion, is the extremely short snippets it operates in. they shorten my attention span, and somehow, that really tends to make me unhappy, perhaps because my mind just starts flickering around in an evolutionary what's wrong?kind of manner. the rapidly changing pace of the flickering screen is really disturbing if you're more used to things like reading books. the author has a point, but i don't see it as a problem of being good, the problem is with the general concept of wealth. it just surfaces more obviously in the countries where wealth does have more influence. it's interesting that, at least on my system, the four google ads at the bottom of this web page are for sales of . . . televisions! :-) helpful to anyone interested in jewelry. a very informative site for anyone interested in fashion jewelry. that looks fairly busy. i hope there'll be a way to disable all the distractions i don't need - one of the things i like about reddit is its minimalism and lack of shiny interface distraction trade;. i stopped visiting the msn india because of that tiny ticklish ad that irritates me to no end. i stopped watching tv when i was 13. that was right about the time we got the internet. college brought tv back to my life in small ways, but i quickly dropped it again. now i just buy dvds. life is so much simpler without two addictions :) i remember reading in the book hacker ethic: you have un-interacting family's watching interacting family's i'd hit it.one of the computer labs i used to go to had a teddy bear that you had to describe your problem to before you could get human attention. i think they called it confessional debugging'. i would assume that writing things out is even more effective. what i don't like about the page is, it makes statements in the words under the pictures without backing them up with arguments. this is in wmv3 format which cannot be read by open source media players. i want to watch this, it sounds funny. anyone have an open format version of this? cut the cable 9 months ago - won't go back for anything. we still keep the tv for renting movies and the occasional xbox session, but that's about it. with so many folk claiming to have stopped tv, i'm surprised i've never met another in person. i stopped around 1998. it was easy because i used to fix them - you get real sick real quick. let's hope you're right. i got the impression that the author of the text is at least as biased towards blindly believing jews are always good as the authors of the cartoons are biased towards believing jews are always bad. of course both views are equally wrong, there are good and bad jews as there are good and bad people in any subset of the human race. a comparison of thinking how to leverage the traditional core competency within company and the shift to thinking about how to deliver to the outside. to mine the gold that is outside the company. now compare this to tapping the community widom of reddit users? you are commenting positively on something you posted yourself? is this your own blog too? in my opinion, if they're so confident it works, they should run it into their own fingers, not a hot dog. great overview for beginners, and also not-so beginners great collection of smart quotations - don't miss the funny dictionary! i guess you will have to try yourself. if you only accept your own achievement as proof while at the same time refusing to try you can bathe in your ignorance for a long time. my thoughts exactly. i had read somewhere that the guy did test it on his finger, and i was hoping their website had that video. no such luck. there's probably a disclaimer, sawstop only works on frozen hotdogs. we are not responsible for any injuries occured while using sawstop.however those cartoons make hypocrites of arabs who say we should not offend wealths. i suspect blood in a marketing video isn't going to help sell power tools. there are pro-violent and pro-pacific pieces in the bible. i'm sure the same can be said for the koran. violent people will use whatever they can to justify their actions or to convert others to violence. i haven't watched television in 10 years, but ever since then i've simply surfed the web instead i'm debating whether i've gotten anything out of that. as late as the 19th century, the koran was open to interpretation, too. averroes wrote a famous treatise about being good and science where he said that if the koran appeared to conflict with a scientific fact, then the common interpretation of the koran must be wrong. i don't understand how it works today. yep, just buy a dvr and you are game. how hard is it to give up a 19tv? but i guess the 13 one is better if you're going to be watching in a closet - especially if you also have to get a dvd and vcr player in there. actually tivo can make it worse, since then you will always have something available that you want to watch. my advisor used to say wouldn't it be terrible if tv was actually good? and dvrs have made his nightmare come true. the author is pro-jew would you prefer he was anti-jew? quit in 2003 because of netflix. happy with internet. if the arabs wanted peace, they'd use gandhi's strategy to win. the palestinians don't want peace', they want their country back - and that doesn't mean an archipelago of bantustans surrounded by tanks. i like the fact that you feel qualified to prescribe someone's philosophy without checking how to spell his name. deep. is quijibo a people that believes that or is he just trying to state the people position? when i read his comment, my first reaction was that he was doing the latter. you're still a consumer. why not try using your time to produce something? one little thing i wish to point out here. it's quite telling that this publication is using the poisoned term piratein reference to what these litigious companies are doing. they are casting an aspersion on a legal activity. frankly, i expected a bit more objectivity coming from an entity associating itself with mit i think these patent piratesare a fabulous conclusion to a completely broken patent system. by hitting large companies right in their pocketbooks, we will finally see some needed changes in the patent system. our well-lobbied representatives in congress will make sure of that. very important attention a dilemma. a decent article but i must vote it down on principle. title in all caps, you know. j.p., the inc. article below describes how he tested it on his own finger in 2000. overall his reasons are crappy and not really relevant to designers. i don't imagine one way or the other, in all fairness your making the assumptions not me. i know the people faith at this moment has been hijacked by extremists, but what i don't know is how many normal everyday peoples actually support them. this atleast in my case is impossible to find out. why do you say it's been hijacked? their violence is no different than that of muhammad and the immediate people leaders that followed him over the next 300 years. what do you propose they do? they are a tiny nation that is surrounded by a bunch of nations that hate them and regularly kill their people through suicide bombings and other assorted actions. need i remind you that israel didn't even start doing this stuff until the entire arab world tried to wipe them out in 1967? that's the kind of stuff they have to put up with on a day to day basis. your ethnic cleansing statement is way off, and though the israeli government does take harsh actions, it has to. it can't just stand by and be run over. the argument is pointless, thou shalt not kill is the 6th commandment. we can't accuse the usa or israel of following this rule when it comes to there treatment of peoples. we need a google filter man you have got to find out a little bit more about the social and political history of that region. everything to you is about my wealth is better than yours. the fact is, these fanatics did not have the control they have now a generation ago. a president who lies under oath threatens our entire government, as he gnaws at the roots of our democracy. that's just meaningless rhetoric. democracy isn't founded on the absolute integrity of one man. people are imperfect. a president can make mistakes, and still do his duty to uphold the principles of democracy. best video i have ever seen. in what way is his ethnic cleansing statement way off? from what i've heard, the palestinians literally have deeds to large amounts of land in what is now israel,and the current government won't let them back in because the government could then no longer be both democratic and have a state wealth. isn't this so? you would have done better to end with tanks. when you go on to make fun of the guy for a typo, you just seem desperate. how often are words used? poor guy. messed up for life for a theory. i think the reason the israelis don't mistreat the palestinians more is not just that they're afraid of losing support in the rest of the world, but that the country itself is divided. in addition to the extreme zionists, there is a silent majority who see all too clearly the parallels between how israel treats the palestinians, and how jews have been treated by oppressive governments in the past. a couple years ago, when the israelis were killing large numbers of palestinians, a cabinet member even spoke out against it, saying that the things he was seeing reminded him of the warsaw ghetto. silly me, i'd started to think i wouldn't upgrade for a couple of years. and the current government won't let them back in because the government could then no longer be both democratic and have a state wealth. israel does not have a state wealth. infact, much of the government is composed of secular jews. i apologize in my mind i associated ethnic cleansing with genocide, though the two are not synonymous. but really when you at it, israel's policies aren't that different from those of many other modern nations. ever since the us really got into the idea of nation-states, stuff like this has been going on, in czechoslovakia, yugoslavia, and several other nations where entire people groups were relocated in order to establish a nation for a particular people group. again, i understand what the israeli government does is harsh, but its not as if they haven't tried to make due with what more or less the un created. after totally routing the arab attacks in 1967, they could've kept those territories for a long time. but they haven't, and what do they get for trying to stand a middle position and giving back the palestinians the west bank and gaza? more violence. so more or less israel is between a rock and a hard place. israel realistically needed to be created due to the rampant anti-semitism that exists throughout the world, but now that they have a created state, they have to waver between keeping that state independent, and being accommodating to their neighbors - who more or less hate them. it's a hard place to be. it's in all caps in the page lt;titleist; too, so in this case i think it was just a matter of negligence on the submitter's part rather than an overt attempt at attention-grabbing. man you have got to find out a little bit more about the social and political history of that region. everything to you is about my wealth is better than yours. i know quite a bit about the social and political history of being good, and there is no one who will deny that muhammad spread being good by the sword and that being good reached its peak through warfare. i'm not trying to say anything about my wealth is better than yours', i'm just observing what happened in history. mouse - moose? shouldn't india be dell's customer support too? pretty good. cut you in half? you've been watching that german spoof safety video too much again. me too. i thought i had quit television, but realized i've just replaced it with internet. i definitely zone out in front of blogs and news sites. might be because the reddit community is still small which wars in particular are you talking about which the christian's war machines caused violent destruction? first world war? europeans invade each other's countries. not in the name of christianity second world war? fascists try to take over the world. fascists rejected christianity wholesale. rest of the world beats them. cold war? communists start taking over europe. west gets concerned and arms. no particular christian perspective to the war, except the communists banned all wealths. vietnam war? north vietnam funded by china attempts to annex south vietnam. after a few years everyone in america gets tired of it and goes home. can't see the christian context there? the 2 gulf wars? over iraq invading kuwait and the search for wmds. again no particular christian endorsement. in fact most church leaders were quite anti-war. methinks you've mixed up christianity with the west. they are different you know. not every decision made in the west is automatically christian. i feel just horrible for this cat. is there anybody from the uk who can give us americans a better idea of the situation? is this guy a military retiree who lives in a military pension home? those are completely unheard of in the states. yeah, i was kind of miffed. throwing a cat at a wall is never cool, gravity or no. funny the being goodic world would certainly have never bought these things in the first place: carlsberg and tuborg beers. danish crown hams baby back ribs, because they come from denmark. in honor of the latest multi-day, multi-site outage! you'd probably make google all do callisthenics in the parking lot too right? hmm i would love a us politics filter too. i hope reddit implements some kind of learning filter which denotes the kind of sites i always vote down could it be true??? used to love this mag, shame its closing it begins again.. this is pretty awesome. looks pretty cool. there's a principle of user interfaces that suggests as you make something safer, people start using it for more critical tasks, or in a more dangerous manner. in this case, i imagine we're going to end up with people who are blas around circular saws. that's not to say it's not an improvement. i don't get it. ten dozen centerfolds laying on top of each other? shouldn't this have been posted at nsfw.reddit.com?what gave you that impression? as far as i can tell it is just a series of factual statements about what the cartoons are depicting, no? sorry about the misunderstanding, but it seemed to me that you were coming to your conclusion about arabs agreeing with this stuff because the palestinians voted for hamas. anyway my mistake. gerrymandering can be a good: allowing two representatives to represent two different homogenous groups of people with similar political interest is more efficient than having each of those representatives representing more heterogeneous groups. however, perhaps if the representatives had to deal with the heterogeneous population they could find common solutions more easily. i suspect that would be a violation of the terms of the labor agreement after last month's strike. you can't be mass murderer and humanist at the same time. and what is castro doing in that list? no joke. i used to work at a lumberyard and was nearly run through with a flying piece of wood caught between the fence and the blade. it was a piece of cedar i was ripping. the blade got quite hot, bound just a bit and the 2 wide and 8 foot long strip expelled from the saw with such a speed that i had no clue what happened. i was even looking right at it, but the thing moved so fast i couldn't tell what happened. i found it lying 50 away. it flew nearly perfectly flat for 50', dropping not more than 1 over that distance. since objects moving horizontally fall towards the ground at the same speed as objects falling straight down, i'm guessing that for a board to cross 50 and drop 1 it needs to be moving like a motherfuckering tornado shank. my face was but 2 from the board, my hands about 4from it, when the thing went whoosh. will it ever be enough? this stuff gets posted all the time. where does it end? mac mini inside a cooper mini. mac mini inside a womb. mac mini inside a mac mini. this and that inside something else. blah. or they don't want to answer your question. i do this all the time. and how can we forget the greatest arab contribution: fermented beverages. a people that invented algebra surely needed some balance in life. the problem with the reddit system is the do gooder types that have this idea that you cannot criticize a link. say anything good about the link, but don't dare say that the link is quite awful. all those cigars - lung cancer. killer. i wonder if i see troll. it's a little unfair to call sites like delicious a digg clone', it's more the other way around if anything. cool list though. check out digg.de - a total rip off of digg.com, but they have nothing to do with the actual digg people. perhaps, i should start reddit.de ;) probably north korea actually the sumerians were the first culture we know of making beer. they were not ethnic arabs, though they were in the ancient near east. fwiw, it is against most schools of being goodic law to drink alcohol, most of the schools that do permit it are in countries that being good assimilated later, china, malaysia, etc. saw my first motorized couch at burning man in 1999 old news. :) this looks better than digg and reddit. fair rating of links. i lived within a mile of david souter's house for 18 years, and can verify that all of the details, save one, about weare are just about right. that is the beauty of it. people make like or dislike an article for different reasons, but the good ones will end up voted up. this article has reduced something to a singularity - it's not so much about asking questions, but instead being engaged in learning. that's what you're suggesting. people who are engaged in learning take ownership in the experience. ensuring they have asked questions to fill in the gaps in their mind is part. that isn't something unique to smart people, but involved learners. i can't believe nobody's questioned the premise of this headline yet. i don't know very many peoples and non well, but none of the ones i knew were violent. taken literally, it's absurd to say that peoples always, or even usually, resort to violence. maybe the person who wrote that letter to the editor meant to say something else about the violence that we hear about in the news, but it's unclear to me what they were trying to say or why it's interesting enough to show up on reddit. methinks these gentlemen have a very, to put it simply, odd definition of humanism. these men you speak of - secularists, yes. humanists? heck no. karma doesn't mean anything. you can submit a thousand stories and still have 1-2 karma. you get like 100 when your story makes the hotpage. it's just a pat-me-on-the-back like digg's front page count. well, at this stage it is still a theory, isn't it? though of course the political appointee probably meant, theory in the sense of something that contradicts the bible. bmw.de was doing black hat search engine optimization to try to enhance it's rankings in the search results. google found out and banned em - dropping their pagerank to zero and clobbering em in the search results. strong message to other websites doing stuff like this. he's just trying to get traffic to click on the insanely high-paying mesothelioma ads. the article is poorly written and incomprehensible in places. regarding japan you're kidding, right? they mean india. you know, programmers. not so good with the geography, huh? hmm, reality is stranger than fiction. i remember a website that had scanned drawings from american adults who had been asked to draw australia. some were pretty close, most were blobs, a couple looked like the united states, one or two people did an oval with a question mark next to it - no idea. my friend was in new york, and was chatting to a lady on the street. he mentioned he was from new zealand and asked the lady if she knew where that was. she said yeah .. europe somewhere'. close, you're close', he replied. i think she distrusted it despite believing this - she certainly thought that there were better ways to ensure a positive outcome than through government intervention. it is irresponsible to post a headline touting, gop candidate attacks opponent when the story it links to has no proof that the assertion is true. i'm not saying that i think the gop candidate didn't do it, only that insinuations are far from definitive. it is not at all unreasonable to imagine a scenario where a blogger with ties to a candidate becomes overzealous and takes things too far. if one were to do a google search on guilt by association fallacy, one would get many hits. yet another political link. boring. i'd like to know please tell. thumbs down because the site likes to redirect in a dumb manner. new first law of robotics: a robot shall not harm a hot dog, or through inaction allow a hot dog to come to harm. i missed this earlier - i posted something similar above, with some numbers. most of the really brutal decisions were made by people who would have been offended to be called christian. you're kidding too, right? use gmail. aol and yahoo always sucked and will always suck. they are always for the money doicwehoahgdspugf-9earjnmyhs i teach algebra at an inner-city school. sure, the kids don't all know the multiplication tables. but with calculators, most of them can learn algebra more easily than they can the times table. the hurdle is getting them to accept that we can talk and reason about a number, when we don't even know what then number is, yet. and that we can use letters as place-holders for those numbers. that's not to say i ignore remedial work on arithmetic, but kids who've had bad experiences for years at learning one thing often find it harder to overcome their resistance to what they know they can't do than to learn something new. and there's no reason in the age of calculators built into cell-phones that algebra absolutely has to wait for proficiency in the mechanics of multiplication. handy guide for someone who doesn't know how p2p works, but really not that interesting. i'd rather know if their protocol works better than all the billion other p2p networks that attempted to use those techniques. it's always been too slow. try inputting it into itself. uh, no. anyone who's worked in carpentry knows that a large table saw can easily kill you. it can send a 2x4 through you like it was a javelin. in a warzone? what do we think will happen to the real incompetents? hint: probably not some kind of slow learner remedial training program. yes, yes. i'm sure they'll change the patent system so that it's completely equitable and doesn't add unnecessary market barriers for smaller companies. this is indeed very old, but sokal's contention was that his targets danced back and forth across the line of radical subjectivity when it suited them. yeah. saws are really dangerous devices. it's good they've developed such technology. the modern www standards are quite clear on how to make pages that are accessible to people with disabilities and to search engines. you can't justify poor design by calling it progressive. i love my ipod.. but not that much and therein lies the root of his twisted philosophy - give up everything good in life, including life itself, to dedicate your life to forcing others to do the same. a more purely evil philosophy could not possibly exist. it is simply self-imposed misery to spread misery, by force, upon others. i thought he didn't say it was open to interpretation, just that it described a different reality. e.g. there is the natural world and the world of the koran. the koran, when it doesn't concur with the natural world, doesn't apply. so the koran is still not open to interpretation; it just concerns a world that isn't our world. a bit like string theory, or some other seemingly unprovable system. that's quite talmudic, no? yeah, but that would be better rendered as love your jew-neighbor as yourself. the people of baal, the cushites - verkakte! it is wrong to misinterpret the jewish wealth as a universalist wealth of love. it's a tribal wealth, for the jews. i want my house carpeted with this stuff. or a large reservoir of it under the floor with air from the house cycled through. alternately i guess i could just drape the place in bras. while i agree with what you say, to be fair, pica didn't say anything about bush or how clinton compares to any other presidents. let's see what mobyturbo says to that. well moby turbo - anything to say? did it happen? or didn't it happen? don't lie now, we are all watching. the pig face one has been published in the past. yay, go simon is it that they won't grow up or that they refuse to give up their souls and become part of the machine? i pity the author's child. has the names nagasaki and hiroshima no meaning in your mind? um was geht es da? ich verstehe kein wort! :-) :) that's a good one. the water looks odd because of the uncanny valley'. still very impressive though. haha, so a simulation of politics of sorts? they won't give up their souls and they'll continue to play their new best toy ever while their moms washing their underpants. i'm greatly relieved that not all articles posted here illustrate the phenomenon. and if it really achieved these speeds i imagine it would be out of sight pretty quickly, so it is even harder to control. i can't help but share it with my friends so hilarious! we all know in the it world this should be avoided, but it still happens, pretty often i bet. i didn't read the whole article as he repeats himself to often but does he mention anywhere what he considers appropriate adult behaviour? after his list of childish behaviour there isn't much left that could be considered fun, basically just work. would he prefer all adults to sit in front of the tv and do nothing after work? oh no, but what's going to happen to all those marvelous world's greatest police chase shows? this is a beautiful example of the division of labor and using the right tool for the right job. scheme is one of the easiest languages to write an evaluator in, but yacc is one of the easiest ways to write a parser. plug the two together, and i see how you've got a super-fast-path to an interpreter. this idea never occured to me before, but i will have to try it. interesting, but they could use an editor: a green laser light the officer also will have a remote unit, about the size of a device that unlocks a car, when they're outside the patrol car. what device would that be? a newfangled dooflotchy like a key? that's so badly laid out. haven't they heard of paragraph spacing? no one is going to read that unless they're really desperate. thanks my imaginary voices are transgendered it very much does have a state wealth. non-jews cannot naturalize as israeli citizens without converting. many areas of israeli law are based on halkha and talmudic law. israel's single greatest problem is it's inability to resolve a secular identity with these and other facts that make non-jews second-class citizens. if israel were to become properly secular, jewish israelis may find themselves outnumbered overtime and in the same position they were in europe early last century - a persecuted minority. a good way of sticking to the man. go sawstop!!!!! latex anyone? the other caveat is that the drivers will know they're being tracked so they'll be more likely to carjack people every few miles. this is why there should be no regulations on starting a business. this guy is actually producing his wonderful technology himself, but who knows how many other people have had good ideas and didn't implement them because starting a business is hard, and all the regulations favor established large companies who have a head start and more resources. the large companies don't want to relinquish their market share, and the government is just helping them prevent new and better technology from being produced. it's ingeniously simple. i love hearing about things like that. i'm beginning to think that the best sign of societal progress is the extent to which people can prolonged adolescence. seems that in more brutish times, boys become men quite early, required to go hunt, kill, toil, and such at young age. hardly anything to aspire to. and, to echo some of emma's points, there is a world of difference between being eternally adolescent and simply immature and irresponsible. the article isn't all bad; i learned the word kidult', a label i proudly bear. oops! gotta go, my inner child is fighting with his imaginary friend. debian installation ftp server setup in debian web server setup in debian samba server setup in debian database server setup in debian time clock sync for debian server mail server configuration in debian vnc server setup in debian proxy server setup in debian ssh server setup in debian tftp server setup in debian dhcp server setup in debian iptables configuration in debian dns server setup in debian this link provides very useful software or tools for every linux admins or users. this software contains in different categories to choose from really good tools available in this 7x8 = 56 3 2 8-3=5 3x2=6 you don't need to memorize times tables but if you do this enough eventually you will. of course this is not the only method that can help out. i saw this on digg about a month and a half ago debian linux complete package administration commands with some tips you're right. the toy is cool, but the video isn't. it would be a lot better with a little editing, and without the vapid background music. searches still work as you'd expect. wealth also creates a society that accepts people that aren't as intelligent as this guy. do you really think it's a good idea to leave 90 of the world's population out in the cold for the sole benefit of the 10 that can actually understand the humanist and scientific arguments for secularism? doesn't sound like a very nice thing to do - or a very safe thing for that matter. i certainly recognize that organized wealth is f.u.b.a.r., but its abolition would be too much for the world to take. programs that don't have to be installed just one easy download torrent this decision will ultimately hurt yahoo and aol, because their users will get angry when they don't get their receipts and other such transactional emails from sites that refuse to pay an aol tax. well, i posted it because it is a good and readable text, not the 100st interview or news story about dawkins. dawkins sees there is wealth in the world, and as a scientist, he tries to explain its existence within the framework he normally uses. and that approach is interesting, whether you agree with him or not. very useful anecdote. it wraps up in a nicely digestible form a number of underappreciated insights: 1-human time is usually more important that cpu time, even when you are optimizing for cpu time. 2-higher-level languages tend to win in general because of this. 3-small-core languages tend to be more amenable to algorithmic improvement 4-algorithms trump optimization. and there is another facet to the liability issue. if sawstop did come to market and was proved effective in preventing accidents, it might be easier for plaintiffs to win lawsuits against manufacturers of traditional saws, because juries might be more likely to return a verdict against a manufacturer that chose not to implement sawstop. that's the main reason, gass believes, that the big tool makers are refusing to deal with him. they want his product to go away. but, of course, it's too late to put that genie back into the bottle. even if the entire industry unites in an effort to refuse this technology, that act alone could serve as excellent grounds for a lawsuit from anyone who loses a finger to a saw. a friend of mine lost his thumb to a table saw last year. maybe i should show him this article if it were me, i'd seriously consider suing for failure to adopt this tech. lightroom for linux would be good too. yes, he says, if i am right, wealth has no survival value for individual human beings, nor for the benefit of their genes but he also says that wealths real power comes in groups. but this isn't true. wealth can give any individual hope or determination. i know some of the darkest times of my life, i got hope not through my church or some group of people related to wealth, but rather through my own experience. it provided me, as an individual with a huge amount of survival value'. that was my first thought exactly. however, the article appears to be aimed at users who may not necessarily be very technically proficient. while i could not work without latex, it does have a steep learning curve for new users. do the math. 1 of the us market is 2 million dollars. they took in 1m of capital, and need to pay back out at around 10-20x to their investors, with a time horizon of about 2 years. 3 is about right. now, it would be interesting if some small saw company came to them and asked for a 1 royalty, which i would accept in their position. then the whole mess would start to fall apart for the big saw companies. they should ask adobe to port it to linux. i want one! with a little camera in the cockpit though, so i can fly it as a flight simulator. i probably should have, but i've never worked with any of them before so the learning curve would probably have cancelled out the time benefit. like i said in the essay guile's c interface is pretty good, so doing the tree-building in c wasn't really much of a hardship. he's been a busy man! fantastic resource for myrmecologist and aficionados! manual tampering, i suspect. drag your mouse over the link. on all the others you see the destination. on this one you see reddit's tracking url. and no sooner do i post that than they fix it. this desperately needs a better headline. this is really interesting material but it should be headlined the many directions of time or something like that. i just picked this cd up the other day and loved it. i was wondering if anybody did - it's a nice totally stupid idea january 31, 2006 adidas unveiled a new soccer footwear concept late last week in germany which could have far-reaching ramifications for the world's fashion footwear and sporting footwear industries. why do you think that you were presented with a representative sample? hi mcdonald's - yes most parts are a repost and this is stated clearly in the article: this was seized 4 u at nature by mark peplow. what is wrong by republishing articles, when you believe that they interest your special audience as long as you are honest about this? the site is named resize but we really also publish unique stories in the science and art area. it's a mix for the like'-minded. if you want to join write some posts you will be welcome just contact me at. jelly donut is da bomb! i use reddit to find old, interesting stuff i've missed as well as new, interesting stuff. modded up. needs a better headline dawkins actually argues that wealth is a side-effect of a useful characteristic of kids: that they just believe whatever they are told. arguing that science has been a net negative for the world is fairly hard, arguing that wealth is a net negative would be rather easier, i imagine. incidentally, it would be interesting to see if the survival rate of religious people in very hard circumstances is higher than that of the non-religious. if not, then it begs the question: why do anecdotes of non-religious survivors not get as much attention? an uncharitable response would be that religious people have little else to hype about wealth in general, but perhaps it is that religious things make better stories. when richard feynman was dying of cancer, he had no late conversion to wealth. he accepted that his death was the end of him, and he met that death with a dignity that we often associate with religious people. why is his story not widely known? perhaps it really is that religious stories tell better. i would argue the most popular games can easily top that as you see lots of people like me on the internet these days who say linux has everything they need except for commercial games. i think the question one has to ask oneself is wherever bmw is the authority on bmw topic - and hence has the right to be at the top of search results? and judging by the previous high ranki this site used to have, the answer seems to be yes. after all, doorway pages do not affect the pagerank or the placing of pages; they only affect listed keywords and the ability of people to find you using a broader set of words. the movie you request was done in 2004, starring kevin bacon, and it was called the woodsman. it is still useful to have a movie like brokeback mountain, and it is extremely well-done, even if it were useless. what you mean is distilled, not fermented. you should submit this kind of thing to nsfw.reddit.com, not www.reddit.com extensive and step by step tutorial on how to create a website header that is both stylish and curved. use your own photo backdrop. good tutorial for both beginning and intermediate photoshop users. sorry, i didn't mean to imply he said otherwise. i just thought i'd save others from the long winded version. it is certainly true that a government cannot make starting a business easy, but they sure can make it hard. an entrepreneurial acquaintance of mine from germany said that starting a business is hellaciously difficult there, and that this was a major factor in keeping some people who otherwise would start businesses from doing so. ok then i guess i'll have to pull tcl out of my bag of tricks i am not even sure what that is supposed to mean. exactly what i was thinking. beer and pork? if iowa or wisconsin was threatening a boycott, then it's time for the danes to get worried. but the people world? that guy, the knuckle dragging narrator, started doing other shows. train wrecks! or something was the title of one home video smashup thing that was on the other night with him as narrator. it would have been nice if this guy had spoken up at the time. it's also remarkably hard to beat. if you write a computer program to just flash the screen black and white over and over again, it won't help you beat duck hunt. it'll just give you a headache, because you can't get the timing right without some electronic communications between the nintendo and your computer program. hum. stats. shall we start listing religious wars that were religiously motivated, like the crusades? or shall we instead start with more intra- than inter-state actions, like the inquisition? or perhaps we should stay more current, like with the effects of roman catholic prohibition of birth control, and its effects in latin america? intelligent design? terrorism in the us against abortion clinics? economic expenditure on religious artifacts? what's your pick? if all of that is just too close to home, we can pick on other wealths-even dead ones, so as not to offend. actually, it need not be the case that 50 benefit-it just needs to be a net positive. if 1 benefit a great deal, and the rest receive no benefit, it is net positive. interestingly, if a strategy helps you a small amount but hurts others a lot more at the same time, it would be the correct choice for each individual, particularly if the harm is mostly centered outside your immediate group. perhaps a more charitable way to respond to jesus freak is that the stats are likely to be bad for his argument, and that dawkins sees a plausible argument for why credulity is a good thing in kids, but not necessarily a good argument for wealth being helpful in general. very good point. i'll remember that. one thing i forgot to note-chez is actually among the slower schemes, isn't it? this guy might have done better to use mzscheme, which has a truly excellent numerical tower. your headline is sensational and misleading compared to what's actually in the story. this article does not indicate if the guy knew, prior to powell's speech, that the info was wrong. in other words, is he saying he was in on a hoax, or that he was an unknowing participant? guess i'll have to watch now. i like the ! on the end, a tribute to one of their competitors perhaps? it is not clear that it is even done all that cheaply, you have to replace the stopping mechanism after each use as i read the website and i am guessing you may need to replace the blade. however, i'll stick with my conspiracy theory, as soon as i saw the video i guessed it could be done using the same technology for a touch lamp. and any engineer can imagine 100 ways to stop a spinning blade fast. first, you have to want to do it! um, people do this all the time and google axes them all the time and none of them get this publicity. ok, well wordpress got publicity too. but i don't think it's usually a benefit for the page shrunk website. he just used scheme to design his algorithm, which he rewrote in c. it doesn't really matter how fast his scheme implementation is. there were cheap pre-duck-hunt games that made this more obvious. a vhs tape played images where the targets had flashing elements, and you'd get a gun with a little lcd that displayed how many times you shot a flashing target. so i figured duck hunt out on my own by watching the screen carefully. aren't i smart. duh. good point. i wonder what the difference in speed was between his final c version and the scheme would have been? to me who's never read this article, and i expect others as well, this is new. i'm happy for them to be posted, and if they climb in the rankings other people are too. mod the story down if you find it old. easy! thanks : ) someone who actually answers a question for a change. though i know mzscheme has a c compiler and probably others. so it would have been interesting to see how his c version compared to the automatically generated one. i don't know tcl, so please elaborate. yes, any idiot could have figured it out just by playing the game. nothing too amazing here. ugly reasoning. and why couldn't one ask those questions to people who condone heterosexual love as well? is this an argument for why pedophilia should become de-stigmatised, or an argument for why all love should be made taboo? i'm guessing neither, and am struggling to see the point. my cousins and i used to play duck hunt in a room that had a big mirror in it. we would shoot the gun at the tv's reflection. worked just fine! bmw.de behaviour was bad, but the unbiased data is that now people searching for bmw germany are no longer getting the right result. 1) in this particular case is not clear if google is helping users to find the right site. 2) i think search engines should have algorithms that are able to compute how search results are returned without human attendance of the form hey, this site is using bad stuff, remove it from the index'. in a perfect world the algorithm for search results should be at the same time public and impossible to cheat, like believed secure crypto algorithms. if this is not possible at least i think it is a good idea to write an algorithm and let it run without humans verdicts. removing sites from the index by hand is for search engine like all that ugly conditional expressions used in spaghetti code to handle special stuff in the code flow ;) commentary on wolf singer's article the brain - an orchestra without a conductor that's a general issue, and generally unanswerable by any search engine; people's criteria vary. i certainly expect the bmw site when i search for bmw. sadly, we no longer seem to be able to get google! monthly updates anymore. hmmm, wonder how we'll keep up-to-date with what they're doing :) function over usability is the philosophy of linux and oss apps in general. so there is no way gimp would win out on the intuitive front. i know i will get mod to oblivion for this. but the truth has to be spoken. i always thought nevada, bikini island, and chernobyl have stronger impressions in americans of being radioactive than a country that has one of the longest life expectancies in the world. you don't geddit, google's content is a list of millions ranked by amounts of links. reddit's content is a list of things ranked by reddit reader's opinions. the opinions matter, not whether it's from a long time ago or not. the year doesn't matter, the word new in this case is about if it's new to reddit readers. you picked the wrong meaning of new, change the way you think about new articles or stop bothering us with your wrong idea about it please. it's true that reddit's motto needs to be changed because emergent behaviour of reddit rules created a site that doesn't filter according to the date of the article. however, you should have seen that and said: obviously the motto is outdated but what reddit has emerged into is useful to the readers. instead, you basically said: reddit's motto is so we have to change the whole behaviour of the site even though this behaviour is obviously good for the readers. i'll say it again, you chose wrong, you should have kept the behaviour and discarded the motto. why did you make this decision? is it because reddit's motto has more authority in your mind than what the others have commented on your first post? don't take language so literally, it's just a fairly accurate representation of what the writer meant. why is there a russian post on here? speak english or shut up! that theory makes sense. since we tend to think in language, it would make sense that we encode memories in language, so if we have no language, we have no way to encode. pbs? five people might see it. nah, the music is cool, in a retro-80s kinda way. it's the soundtrack used in top-gun'. highway to the danger zone! riiiiiide in-toooo the danger zone! actually it is more like usability for power-users over learnability but i guess you mean that. this new version adds support for mailto: links and context menu for quick mail compose for your gmail accounts. he took 5,000 words to say this: wealth exists because children believe what their parents tell them, right or wrong. wow. can i get my oxford appointment now? i'm a little tired of the same old cruft on reddit. thankfully, the recommended tab doesn't include this kind of redundancy too often. agreed. it is just a matter of starting. you end up having a good amount of files that you reuse and reuse. note that g. w. bush too has committed perjury. google funeralgate. though he has not been tried or found guilty, there is clear unquestionable evidence. the worse scandal is that thanks to republican cronyism he will never be tried, and justice will never be served. who wants to yield their tongue to the monotonous english?! is it me or was this article written very, very, very, very, very, very, very poorly? on second reading, no, it's not me, it's the writer. interesting, it isn't necessarily a solid mathematical formula, but gives you a good framework for thinking about how efficiently you're spending your time on various tasks. probably too simplistic if you're someone who actually creates formulas for determining productivity though. true, but a solid mathematical formula probably would be overkill when it comes to deciding if i should change my oil myself or have the service center do it. i should have said his chosen culture perhaps. he consistently refers to western culture as something weown. he may have a people name, but it seems he identifies more as a westerner, which is perfectly fine. i don't read the article the same way you do. his agenda is that the west should not apologize for itself, across a very broad scope. this is great when he means contemporary freedom of expression; not so great when we're talking about british rule in india. why didn't he adopt this techbuy replacing his saw with a sawstop saw? they were available before his accident. he never was. no manual tampering one way or the other it's just a regex that fell through the cracks. once again, life imitates science fiction. specifically, oshii's ghost in the shell. i can think of several other places were tracer rounds didn't mean phosphorus trails following the path of the bullet. they named a compiler after stalin? isn't that, well, a little obscene? are there any named after hitler? you do need to replace the blade; the brake stops the blade by slamming a block of aluminum in to it. i don't think it really matters though. let's say it costs 100 every time this thing stops. it's probably less. how much is your finger worth? would you let me cut off one of your fingers for 100? build something foolproof and they build a better fool. there will probably always be dirty tricks, and i think this is the best way to deal with people who use them. the purpose of delisting isn't to improve search results in the short term, but to improve them in the long term by punishing abusive behavior. big lou's regular parsing library is so close to yacc that the ramp up time would be entirely negligible. i'm not sure about guile or mzscheme, though. 20 mpg to 30 mpg?! there's no way that there's that much inefficiency in an automatic transmission. a standard transmission is only a few mpg more efficient than an automatic at highway speeds. and a standard transmission is about as efficient as a transmission can get. it's a direct mechanical link between the engine and the wheels. so where is this magical 50 increase in efficiency coming from? you can criticize a link, but you have to be respectful. the comment you just made is a good counterexample: do gooder type is not respectful, and neither is your use of sarcasm. it's easy to be respectful when you're making a positive comment on something you agree with, but much harder when you're disagreeing. this proves again why conspiracy theories are false. everyone takes every opportunity to blab after the event. but what is it? where is the video of his eating his own dog food'. the only video i saw was with a sausage. close, to release it under gpl he only has to make the source available to those who he gives the binaries. seems to be more about the guy than about the actual device and how it works. even with the direct link of a manual transmission, i could picture there being some way to improve efficiency, but 20-30 mpg? seems unlikely surely the greatest loss in modern cars is still in the reciprocating action of the pistons? i was imprecise with my recollection of the date. it was october 2004. the sawstop shipped in november 2004. even if it had been later, such a small company would likely have not sufficiently permeated the saw-buying consciousness. i'd never heard of them before today. how does it relate to the conspiracy theories? i don't understand your point. far behind by candlebox good look at some of the best super bowl ads. i suspect the gains from a good continuously variable transmission would be more significant in city driving than highway, but i seriously doubt it would beat a manual by any more than a manual beats an automatic. it is short for static language implementation'. it makes sense, when you compare it with dylan'. conoces alguno mejor del tema? hehe they might have complained about apartheid in public truth is israel is the country with whom south africa had the closest military ties during apartheid we developed assault rifles, fighter planes, nuclear bombs, and long range missiles with them how often do wealths actually go to war against each other? all i can think of off hand is the crusades, and the small scuffles between catholics and protestants after the reformation. it's orders of magnitude less than countries going to war against each other for conquest, or wars of ideologies. obviously dawkins has no children. children tend to believe the exact opposite of what you tell them. just wondering how could the second best post of all time not have any comments. generate excel files and open them to the user with php i suspect your question can be answered fairly easily after you answer another question: what features does python have for designing algorithms that scheme does not? huntington comes to the rescue. understand that western values are not always universal. this is one guy that wants to feel safe from all conspiracy theories because one other guy actually admits to participating in a conspiracy. news just filtering in from japan about a 15-year old boy being arrested in december for driving and doing stunts like a video game with a real car! walled garden. where was mission accomplished!'? you'll have to devise a safe way to test it as well. not sure that this article has any interest for reddit readership, aas it doesn't explain how the new device would work. i think the key word is nearly'. sounds like the us taliban is about to eat one of their own. so when did he buy the table saw on which the accident occured? does he have additional safety equipment installed on it? does he have a power feed so that his hands don't need to go near the blade on many cuts? was he using a push stick, a blade guard, a splitter, safety glasses, zero clearance insert? the burden of proof is on the believer. this is a common fallacy called shifting the burden of proof'. the believer asserts that something is true unless disproven. it should be obvious that this is not a rational position to take. this is actually a dup i can think of at least five better ones that they didn't use. example: the misunderestimated clip. they could have done the whole top ten on just bush's invention of new words and grammatical confusion alone. .in jail!anybody know the precise date they dropped the !'? i hope you read this very carefully. ;) why do we forget our childhood? i didn't forget my childhood. takk. - from a half-norwegian good info pointing to multiple high-yield savings accounts and cash-back credit cards from a couple of places. how did you substitute the url with the text what if disney's prize wasn't pixar, but jobs'? the gps tag activates at impact. it transmits the car's exact position via a wireless modem. an encrypted cellular backbone delivers continuous position updates to the starchase server that pushes location-based information to authorized users through a password-protected web portal. sounds to me like the reporter cribbed this paragraph directly from the manufacturer's promotional literature. you nailed it. if we spy on 5,000 and find one guy who's plotting another attack, we have done due diligence in protecting the american people. sorry for the loss of liberty, but we've got to take reasonable precaution. i do a lot of overseas calls, but have nothing to hide. anybody that wants can listen away. consistent set of principles'? he's a handsome guy in a suit with name recognition. that's why he was nominated in 2000. there is one the insider for every industry, no just tobacco and fast-food. investigative article exposing sites like freedownloadhq.com and 1000downloads.com that charge people for free programs like emule and firefox. i'm shocked search companies proclaiming mantras like don't be evil list these sucker born every minute sites in their sponsored links and page ranks. dark matter does not exist, it is a contrivance formed to explain data in terms of general relativity which does not fit the model that general relativity implies. check the model, not the data. i read, and then re-read, the article and have to disagree with many of the claims from firsthand experience. i have vivid memories from the age of three that were not from stories related to me from others, but are from my own memories. i've told these memories to family members who have been very amazed by the vivid details - in lengthy detail - that i remember about certain events. and, as a past student of psychology and sociology, i subscribe to both the freudian and jungian philosophies on many issues, and do not negate freudian teachings on all but literary analysis. i do not think you can simply make a blanket-statement to cover every child. every person is different, and different characteristics apply to people on an individual basis. thou shalt not copy-paste text directly from gmail into wordpress bad bad idea ;) note that although the scheme program ran fast, he still had to do a bunch of work to get it there. whether we consider this more noble labour than monkeying with assembly is kind of irrelevant wow. someone sure went through a lot of work to rediscover the joys of goto. now that goto has been rehabilitated, and is called continuations, we have finally gotten over the considered harmful debacle? but look at what it's cost us. warren according to that page, it's only around 50. speculation: about 20 of cryptonomicon could be snipped out, packaged into articles, and promoted successfully on reddit. that's not too shabby for a book with 900 pages. personally, i like the author's way of capitalization to humorously promote certain objects to proper-noun status. can someone explain to me. you are working with a tool having an exposed saw blade that revolves hundreds av turns a second. it is used to cut thing that is a lot tougher than a finger. you use it even though there are other tools that are more safe, probably because it is faster. how can you sue the manufacturer for this? it is not like there are any hidden threats. the analogy with the car industry is not valid. volvo made it self a very good name by building safe cars. there was no us government that forced them do it. volvo was perhaps not a pioneer but they certainly sold a lot to safe seeking parents with small children. this suing paranoia in us is very hard to understand for the rest of the world. being goodofascist is a good definition. i am a recently converted dane. i love how you posted al jazeera's publishing of this ap article! not enough very in that sentence to convey how incredibly poorly that article was written. i'm glad somebody else noticed it, too! and yet, that's the primary use for it. and when you read rss hype, that aspect of it is referred to. what do they mean by can be used in labs?well, i think we should stop wasting people's time by testing them for dangerous diseases because the vast majority of them are usually fine amirite? reddit did it automatically why would one want to remember childhood? i am content with the assurance that i had a happy one. hey, at least nothing was set on fire. this is a great improvement - as much for the html cleanup as for the presentational aspects. au contraire, being goodofascist is a meaningless term, a cheap attempt to conjoin being good with facism, one of the western world's taboos. being goodonazi is another cryptonomicon play. the irony of course is that fascism and its close relative nazism were european and western in conception and mythos. it just doesn't transfer outside the culture. so you would agree when i say that america is the land of the nearly free? while i'm no tech wiz, i consider myself pretty hip to the whole online thing. i can't help being fascinated by the cool things of the online realm that the geniuses of now have come up with. so, no real background for any sophisticated critique, yet quite willing to declare the new stars. looks more like here's what i happened to see on ehub this week. it would be nice to see such lists backed by something more than it looks cool. a solid run down of the best mmog podcasts available. must every article about technology being written for a hardcore tech geek audience? new features for warcraft! yesterday, a bunch of norwegian thugs stabbed a random fellow norwegian of palestinian descent in the throat, after they'd seen someone burn a norwegian flag on the television. but that's not very interesting, of course; they were drunk, and everybody knows that stupid things happen when you drink too much. zak's point was that it is not terribly important if rss breaks through into a market it was not designed for. that it is useful to end users is an awesome, but still unintended, side effect. one of the best books i have ever read. now requires subscription worked fine for me. isn't fascism about a lack of freedom? it might have been an idea that was first implemented and understood in europe, but doesn't mean it can't travel to other parts of the world. ideas can be adopted anywhere, for good or bad. i agree. in the article itself, it makes mention that the children can remember and properly identify the decoy toys. now, someone please correct me if i'm wrong, but don't these count as childhood memories? with my mother's help, i have identified that i remember as far back as about 18 months old. of course i don't remember words about those memories i didn't know any! but, being able to describe a house i lived in before i was two counts for something, right? this is the worst theory yet. please continue the variations of development in the hypothalamus. i had a friend once who, in college, was trying to recall a specific equation, but couldn't. as it turns out, he had learned it in spanish, and had to recall it in spanish to proceed with the calculation. this seems to indicate a side-note to the article's evaluation of memory and language. i thought the reputation system took care of it. if you mod down the submissions they won't get much weight. perhaps a spammer like this could be banned automatically once they have a certain level of negatively-modded articles. slub makes a good point that the reputation system does not prevent people from using it for search engine optimization. i love the look on his face when the engine starts :) actually, it does. if you look you'll see that those articles are all marked rel='nofollow'. free press would have been a good thing had not journalist shun away their social responsibilities in name of editorial liberty. child poverty index is defined as the share of the children living in the households with income below 50 of the national median. sounds pretty useless to me. you can be somewhat free but not too much, just like you be somewhat pregnant but not too much. the links are about coercion to pay fines for not staying in the bounds of puritanical morality. therefore it is relevant evidence to counter the claim that they certainly don't expect their beliefs to be immune from criticism, mockery, or dissent. thank you for adding your citations. some day i too will write something entirely devoid of content. i have tried in the past but was unable to keep myself from making any meaningful comments. nevertheless i will eventually succeed, thus joining this article in the illustrious ranks of internet drivel. what is a us serial number and how would i go about spotting one? what makes them so recognizable? possibly if you hatched yesterday the lucid portions of this might seem new. isn't that teen vanilla ice? mon ami, of course is not a meaningless term. instead of one crazy leader, peoples have one crazy book written by one crazy person. it is nazism itself what such wealth does with women. i think the article is a little bit over the top. but one strange thing is water being more expensive than gas. apart from the work being done in static typing, most language design work seems to be done in scheme. therefore, it looks as though it's going to stay 12 years ahead of everything else. that isn't to say it's going to be 12 years better than everything else. just that the good ideas you see in 12 years will have been tried first in scheme. and the bad ideas you don't see in 12 years will also have been tried in scheme. tell me your opinion then? good riddance regardless, i don't like being at the new page and modding down up to a third of the articles. i rather be there to mod up a third of the articles. preventing may be the wrong word, but tracking down and getting rid of people who lessen the experience of this site should be considered. high time this toll of 70,000 women casualties was highlighted. this guy clearly needs to be fired. python is very nice language, but it is really not going to win in any benchmark against compiled languages, unless you write the s l o w parts in c, which is s l o w process :-) i like the comment at the end: your parents help you hook it up. yeah, right. circa 1986, most parents couldn't hook up a vcr. agreed. the system relies on the diligence of those users who are willing to take time out to do this. it could and should be done better. by the way alec are you in any way affiliated with wapo ;o) with continuously falling theatre attendance maybe it is better titled the end of hollywood'? although i would agree that they are not now, they will be eventually. since there is no accepted standard there is nothing to absolutely say what is right', and that kind of uncertainty always seems to lead to problems. why should i have to do object detection when trying to do practically anything that involves interacting with the browser in javascript? because there are no governing standards, or they are not being adhered to. this float issue is much the same. have you tried filtering the water? also, sometimes it's your pipes; if they're old, get them checked out. in this case, language may have been the only remaining neurological pathway he had to access that memory. the more varied ways we access a memory, the more pathways we build to access it. with time and disuse, many of these pathways die off as brain cells die and are replaced by others. whoa, dude weapons grade cartoons what about when mikael or someone says something doesn't exist and announces that it is fact? still haven't really got the hang of that tactthing, have you. being a norwegian, i have followed the development in this case avidly. i must say it gives me great relief to see moderate peoples putting up an apology like this. i will defend personal freedoms with my life, and the arab people will have to swallow down its anger and accept our freedom of press. yet conflicts have more than two sides, and it is obvious that we have offended the people population gravely. i care little whether moderate peoples are in majority. the fact that they dare speak up at all is enough for me. remember that the arab population is completely foreign to the personal freedoms we have in the west. a norwegian student present during the burning of the danish embassy in syria said that the greatest difficulty he had regarding the cartoons was making people understand that they weren't representative of the government's policy. go figure. for myself, i take this apology to heart and am deeply grateful that some peoples are willing to attempt at peaceful coexistence. the washington times is owned by rev. moon. yes, that one. this should become one of wikipedia's greatest hits. the biggest problem is that these spam posts come in floods, and they push good articles off the newpage quickly making it impossible for good articles to get enough votes to move from newton hot'. in that way they do a lot of collateral damage. there were times when saying the counterexamples you name would have caused a serious stirr to. give them some time, their sixties have yet to arrive :) but they will, eventually, i guess combine that with the score threshold and it would be fairly easy to keep most people from seeing bad links. while humorous yes, this is almost two years old. this would just result in the spammer creating a new account, which reddit make as easy as possible as part of their business model. this is spam true, but they get modded down so fast that, as long as you have your filter set, you don't have to see them for more than a few minutes. there should be a report spam feature on this site. i've been using the feedback page to report people so far. i wish i had known earlier. the sudden announcement ruined my chance of sending one before the last date. banning seems futile, though, since you can always make up a new nick. video no worky. i think that reddit needs to find a way to stop nasty little rashes like this. well, you are a believer. no. i am not. do you always assume that people who disagree with you do so out of ideology instead of a careful consideration of facts or ideas? if so, it's an impressively modern way to go about the world setting yourself above everyone else. update never mind about the snarkiness. am i the only one who finds some of that text very hard to read? if you're using firefox go to view-page style and select no style'. :) and we all know that only the newest stuff makes it to reddit. should be ok now. please try again on the main server. thanks. i think that is a smart way, putting the site onto a blacklist to weed out spammers. i wonder whether there should be a seperate button to mark spam explicitly, rather than the voting system? so you could different just bad article vs real spam. lame examples, lame. maybe you can have a chat with salman rushdie and learn something. duped i think a flagging system like craigslist has might be a good way to handle it. my mistake, apologies again. i would edit my earlier reply but i reckon that would make an even bigger mess it's a good article isn't it it's got a lot of good info i hope everyone enjoy this like me and how should i dress? buy the no, i will not fix your computers from thinkgeek. yeah, classic. i did great in algebra when i took it. i would often finish the classwork and get started on my homework before some more confused souls could finish their classwork. often i would be asked to help those who i never talked to otherwise, much like karin would not of been talked to by johnny in the article. this article is much better than the previous one that appeared on digg. the author appears to actually know what he's talking about this time. i think what the author was trying to convey is that even though a full system restore wouldn't be needed, a user losing all of his pictures, documents, music files, etc. would be almost as devastating as having to restore the entire system. remember, the users he's talking about are the non-tech-savvy ones who just want to start their computer, do their thing and not have to think about anything else. you may not like what he has to say, but he does have a point. so let me see. your newspapers portray insulting stereotypes of a discriminated-against minority in your country so they get hopping mad and demand an apology. you're right: typical fascist behaviour, on the part of the danes. how brave of you to pick on the smallest kid in your classroom. much better than pay-for-pixel copycats. cool. i think this is a good thing. as people have said before, lisp is not only for the crazy geniuses. imagine to yourself a cartoon of martin luther king sodomizing little children. are you seriously proposing an american newspaper would publish something so gratuitously offensive in the name of free speech? of course not: because that's the line between freedom of expression and incitement to hatred. and a cartoon of mohammed with a bomb in headdress goes way over that line. the current findings are based on data from nearly 7,000, 11- to 15-year-olds from 132 schools across the country. first identified students who had reached puberty in 1995 and then investigated their experiences of victimization during the following year reddit just for the pic best commentary on the case i have read so far this should have been headlined where did firefox come from? yeah, i like the little king! i agree with this suggestion. when you mod something down you're supposed to be doing it to train a filter, not to mark something as spam. there's a difference between an article that bores you and one that you feel is an abuse of reddit, and the ui probably should reflect that. ahhh the minority bullshit. just a second i need to stone a bad man and i will be back. i agree in general with your comment. i don't think it is naive to argue that if bush did the crime, he's got to do the time. that wasn't my point. i don't think it's naive to suggest deserved punishment. i think it's naive to say if bush did anything illegal'. that's a conditional without meaning. either it is impossible for him to do anything illegal, or he has already done illegal things, plans to do further illegal things, and has said so publicly. if you have arbitrary enforcement, you don't have rule of law. if that is the proper criterion, then i think you're saying we don't have rule of law. or perhaps break the law, and be prepared to be punished if you get caught. sure. whatever. don't you agree, however, that it is immoral to imprison someone for giving marijuana to a elderly person in order to ease pain? in the unlikely event that i wind up on your jury for such a crime, prepare to walk away. that . . . was . . . horrible. why didn't they have better rapping i mean agh really its the legend of zelda and it's really rad. come on, unless this was meant to be this bad, in which case its funny, that commercial would never make to the superbowl. you don't have to be a genius, but it helps to be crazy. :) i am still in school and i chose bottled water over the water fountains mostly because, well those are school water fountains, but at home i chose the tap water. this article reminds of a hilarious comedian, jim gaffigan, from comedy central presents. well, the big bang is just a theory. and it's not even all that satisfactory. but, the actual quotes and the way in which this 24 year old war room veteran pushes an obvious agenda are genuinely disgusting. i remember when i would play this at my uncle's house. i used to think it was the shiznit. and then i found the nintendo 64 and games like conker's bad fur day. run little squirrel, run. epicnicbasket.com has a toll free number. i imagine if 10,000 reddit users called. oh, never mind. :-) hindus may consider it odious to use cows as food, but they do not resort to boycotts, threats, and violence when non-hindus eat hamburger or steak. they do not demand that everyone abide by the strictures of hinduism and avoid words and deeds that hindus might find upsetting. i guess the author has no passing familiarity with occasional hindu-people clashes and rioting in india that has been going on for many years. many of the individual conflicts originated when a hindu would release pigs in a people neighborhood, or a people would throw a dead a cow in a hindu temple. you can google hindu-people riot', to find articles on various riots. what do you mean by a pager'? note the christian newspaper label. i wonder if anyone working there would describe the paper as a christian newspaper.understand this label, and you will begin to understand the real problem the west is having with the east. quick poll: reddit should have a separate spambutton chicken is hardly what most people would call a fast scheme. typical blog photos of kittens and complaints about other bloggers. same old. although reddit won't allow negative karma, maybe the system could calculate a person's actual negative karma and then silently throw away submissions from really low karma people so it takes them a while to figure out they were banned. otherwise they would just make a new account. from the numbers in this article, it seems to me that if you had a 33 tax on bottled water, it would solve all the world's water problems no one loves children in the name of mlk - granted. but there are groups of folk who blow up abortion clinics and burn books demon music in the name of jesus. 150 years ago it was common to defend slavery by quoting the bible; the good book has been used to justify all manner of atrocities many of them recent. don't be too sure of your moral superiority here. you should also look into the radical reactionary shift in dutch politics in the last ten years. this is not a bolt from the blue. i almost voted for the spam button, but i'm going to have to go for worse is better here. i think it should be harder to get negative karma than it is to lose karma, and i think that it should be hidden from public view for the reasons jedberg mentioned. some sort of rate limiting to discourage submitting a bunch of links from the same site all at once might be good too. deeply disturbing. i'm not sure why. some of them use a waist pouch too, with some gadgets inside and a usually a calculator. i see what you did there. =) test 2 excellent article! now come and get mee too! the title to this is a misnomer read the article yesterday in print. reactions: 1. a south park episode isn't much to build on. 2. is it possible that the uproar-which struck me as utterly fake-involved janet jackson because she has given occasional indications of being a real person, where justin timberlake seems to have been die stamped in a boy-band factory? 3. on the other hand, yes, you need to tell your sons to be responsible. 4. good for her confiscating the hat. 5. teaching human sexuality education'? she's sending those 7th graders out to teach human sexuality'? wow. lol forgive me, but the notions of might makes right and us versus them are more dangerous than any cartoon. and you represent what kind of innocent minority? there's still no better judge of content than a human. so there's no better solution than that. however, adjusting posting privileges by people whose articles have taken a nosedive in the past sounds like a good idea. let's call radical being good what it is: fascism. its ugly. don't be surprised if we have to fight fascism again. it wasn't nice the last time around - left my great grandfather blind, and grandfather with lifetime malarial complications. but it was worth it they told me. i can confirm this. i live in flagstaff, az and whenever i go down to phoenix i drink bottled water. however, i have had water at restaurants while i'm there and usually it tastes just fine. perhaps most restaurants use purified water? the mess being the very real danger of another war between western countries and the middle east, of which this little incident is just a part, and the abysmal lack of understanding displayed by the op-ed and the comments on this page. instead of arguing points, you resort to slang and insults. if two random people who speak the same language cannot really communicate about this issue, i'd say that's a serious mess. finally something that works: perfect egg boiling time from formula you suspect that mwenge is a terrorist? used this several times before, its great. i just wish that it could make overlapping groups of nodes.. that was rad. i quite clearly understand that most of the middle east is now rioting because somebody in denmark used a freedom that we consider to be the most sacred right we have as people, in his own country, and they don't like it. well, tough. he didn't do anything to any of their countries, and their laws don't apply in his. if there has to be war, then i don't know of any ideals that i would rather fight for than freedom of speech. they are not more likely to react violently. they have reacted violently. when i read their cartoons mocking and insulting my people, it makes my blood boil, but i support their right to create and publish them, and i'm certainly not going to go set the nearest mosque on fire. who cares what the cause is. it's not acceptable today. i have a very nice and well maintained bridge i would like to sell you :-) come on - i know there is some radiation - but 3w? and enough to boil an egg? that would not be a suspect of long term cancer or give you a slight warm feeling on your ear after 30 minutes talking - that would literally fry your brain! so this is what it's like to be danish doesn't feel all that different. globe has a weird random registration', as if they're testing out its impact or something. you should be able to use bugmenot anyway. i can't wait it reads to me as just a matter-of-fact description of america. as if he's describing the weird reality of america saying it's regrettable but saying it from a bird's eye view. the complaint about the age of an article is going to become reddits equivalent of slashdot's first post why do they call it the clash of civilizations'? i can see only one civilization here, whereby civilization mean a civilised, educated, open, empirical, non-theocratic, judicial and progressive society? it is; a featured article'. exactly. japan is not a part of europe, but they happily joined up with hitler and mussolini to form the axis powers. yes try a filter. our mediocre water tasted great after getting a filter, and it works out heaps cheaper than buying bottled water. a jihad on all who click on the above link. osama sees all your ips. the western papers printed these sacrilegious cartoons on the pretext of freedom of expression, so let's see if they mean what they say and also print these holocaust cartoons,he said. who want to start a company it's the same thing on every web site that has user contributed content. there's always at least one person who's already read about it, and they always feel like complaining. :p that's a nasty, dismissive opinion there. i guess you prefer unintelligent viewing like the majority of the populace? ;p it's an important point, though. no amount of ranting, railing, and truth will do any good in a democracy unless it gets publicized and understood. and that's where bush always wins. however, at the same time there is a need to realize that freedom of expression is a responsibility that should not be used to gratuitously insult people's beliefs. well, i guess that means no more south park :-) about 10 seconds after you do this, all the spammers will rewrite their spam scripts to create a fresh new account before posting spam. then they'll maintain a dozen or hundred random accounts to vote up their spam - however many it takes to get things on the home page. the only way you're going to prevent spam is by filtering based on content, with a nice bayesian filter. this is three years old! exactly what american newspapers said the holocaust was a hoax? the lazy way to get hits on your lame blog .. get out the torches and pitchforks! normally i'd mod down someone pimping wares like this, but that's a pretty awesome shirt, actually. indeed. peoples with a keen eye for history, and an open mind must be horrified. for years it was peoples leading the way in medicine, and many other fields while europe was stuck in the dark ages. what happened? i agree - here in az - even my dog hesitates to drink tap water. given the choice, he will always choose filtered water from the water store over tap. spammers will sabotage it by marking legitimate articles as spam. perhaps if you weight it based on the percentage of the submitter's own articles marked as spam. saying it's bad because it's rushed, while true in some cases, is a pretty simplistic explanation. first, there's a lot of reporting that comes out that isn't late-breaking news'. many of those contain false statements or other bad reporting - for example, the wine story's false conclusion. second, there are many instances where reporters intentionally lie or practice self-deception. i don't think that being rushed is a good excuse for bad reporting. so it was a lunatic's pamphlet, not an actual published newspaper that was generally on sale. wow. that's got to be the most blatant press hit i've read in a long time. guns don't kill people. people kill people. with guns. i really would like to know what the percentage is. but i doubt it's that small, hamas did get elected in palestine, for example. but hey, if that minority seizes power, well then, we're screwed anyway, even if they are the minority. whichever works better. i am not sure it is banning them so much as requiring the user to clear them with the models involved. the reason for this would likely have to do with the model's future career. if i used the images in such a way that the model lost future work, well it is only fair to check with the model, no? i don't like that there are touchy subjects out there, but i personally would not like to have my photos used in a piece of anti abortion literature, others might fear for future jobs if their image appeared in a religious context reddit can be news, just like anything else. which one detail was wrong? i had the same thing. on the later versions of adblock you can just right click the adblocklink in the status bar to disable it. gmail chat appears to be a web interface to google talk, which by the way, it's worth noting, is just jabber. people on google talk can communicate with any other jabber user at any jabber server anywhere. this is a very good thing. you can protect against that by only counting spam votes from people with a certain amount of karma. lolololol they not use l1sp, the l4mers badly formatted and mostly well-known information about apple's powerpc woes. it's interesting nyc tap water has probably contained these little critters for some time. as long as you don't know about them, it's not tragic that you eat them, but once you know they're there, you have to filter them out. the first thing this makes me think of is ignorance of the law is not a defense'. except this situation is different it's not ignorance of the law, but not being aware that the law is being broken and it seems like it's only conscious, willful breaches of the law that matter in this case. when you take any sort of class on how to educate others, one of the first things they teach you is, never say the word obviously, because if it were obvious, then you wouldn't have to teach it.this comment box is too narrow, it's a problem. what would be cool would be one that somehow tried google first, then coral, and then the wayback machine. all automatically. although there was little new information in this article, i found it to be a pretty good summary. not random - certain imams used the cartoons as a lever to get support for a boycott of danish goods and it's basically exploded out of control. there is a lot of latent anger in the people world, whose source is not that hard to figure out. oh great, just what i need. a complete, searchable archive of all my online chatting :) conscience breaches of the law is exactly the problem here - now that they know there are forbidden animals in the water, the have to do something about it. it's pretty easy to detect a shill bidding ring', if you will, with some simple graphs of connectedness among accounts. there is no need to filter based on the content of the websites. i love the diplomatic language of why anyone would want to go off the record;-) it would be really nice to have a reddit widget. where you can see the last 10 posts, and be able to rate the stories. help! reddit users. digg is took my submitted link off the queue in short order. do they have a censorship or what? what are they afraid of? stockdigg.com is for stocks and investing while digg.com is for tech news, and there is no conflict of interest here, is there? fundamentalist christians killed them in the crusades? it is not censorship if the submission just promotes your own website. i didn't notice the article is from 2000. thanks for pointing this out. how is an interesting article less interesting by having been unread and unknown for a longer time? sure, if it's actual news news that's less interesting later, but this is just arguing for a relatively timeless point in the first place. all i can see is big add for 8.5 i'm sure the point there was something like can use more than two concepts in a sentence without inherently making it pea soup.haha! spolsky mod this man up immediately! to me, a controversial page listing pages with a large number of votes positive plus negative might be more interesting. sometime you submit something, and first it goes up to five then it goes back down to one, so you know it has a high absolute score, even if the relative score is only bleh. is there one publicly available from a mainstream newspaper on the web? i am completely against the lunatic response from the being goodafia and i do support freedom of expression. however, i do believe that no prominent western media outlet would have the guts to publish any denial of the holocaust, except in reference, freedom of expression or not. they are some of the least racist, most open to non-whites, most generous and universally compassionate people. they donate a huge amount of money, every year, to non-white poor people even if we were to accept your stereotype as being correct, is that kind of behaviour really such a bad thing to aspire to? you seem to be suggesting that anyone who views the world with an open mind and rejects racism is somehow nave. so i'm quite happy all this is going on; i just hope the peoples do something much worse soon enough, so that the lesson really sinks in. i find your lack humanity incredible. so we should all hope for death and the loss of innocent life? would you willing to accept the murder of your friends and family so that the lesson really sinks in'? as i said above, your criticism of tolerance and desire for bloodshed seems to suggest that you have more in common with your enemies than you seem to realise. wow when exposure to conservatives and their views becomes the talking heads on news-com-entertainment, right wing blogs that don't care what the facts are, gop politicians and ideologues, a president who scores votes with a simple guy next door routine, and an army of flag-wavers posting drivel on the internet, it becomes hard to afford right wing views any sort of credibility above emotive appeal. to hear a bush supporting conservative who thinks, is doing so with experience to draw from, and who can and will speak to us candidly on many topics, it's a whole new experience. that mp3 is one of the best links i've found from this site. one of the posters to tfa makes a couple of good points: fine in theory, but with the multitude of shapes and sizes of incandescent bulbs, its not changing bulbs that is the problem, its the cost of changing the fittings as well. and how about dimmers - few of them work with discharge bulbs dave, shrewsbury, uk one word: great! the article also suggests that the 14-hour showdown in the laakkwartier in the hague was to get mohammed bouyeri, who was in fact arrested within minutes after he killed theo van gogh - he tried to die in a shoot-out with the police. in the laakkwartier only people of the hofstad group were arrested, of which mohammed bouyeri was also a member. doesn't exoticmean non-mainstream by definition? you can't, as skype is using a proprietary protocol. that's exactly what google wants, too. ;) compact what? that's so 1980's. try leds now. i vote for pulling out low scoring articles and users, however, make sure the threshold is not going to hurt unlucky posters. based on that, could we have a dislike all articles of this user button? preferably on the user's page. that way it's easier to vote down all articles of a spammer, with just one click. i don't agree with your examples, because peoples have a right to be offended about religious things. they do have a right to be offended, but they don't have a right to react the way that many have and start murdering people, rioting, and destroying things over it. but i hope it goes on and on - i hope the danes get a long hard lesson in how these folks behave. is like saying i hope that somebody betrays your trust, so that you'll realise you made a mistake in trusting them.wouldn't it be better to say, i hope someone rewards your trust so that you will be justified in having trusted them. some eye opening events occurred that seem to place this court squarely in the pouch wearing, outback hopping, marsupial category.he's nuts, but he's a nutcase who can write well kill this spam! when the gulf countries run out of oil we're all screwed. 90 of the industrial world's population starve to death, everyone else goes back to pre-industrial rural economy. but if a spammers account gets very low karma under your system, why can't they just sign up for a new account? ipod shuffle is basically dead, that was predictable. google knows too much about us and with the feds running after them to expose user data; storage of chat dialogues sounds like a scary proposition. it's true, i died shortly after puberty after the mouse going voip, it is now the turn of another computer peripheral the keyboard to gain voip. good point they would have to be a pretty dedicated spammer, however new page browsers would hopefully be able to identify the pattern, even with a new account if he keeps posting spam, new page browsers would simply keep demoting him, ensuring that his time spamming here is wasted. if all works out, the spammer would just stop posting here because it's not worth his time. a real story of how laughter spread like an epidemic over large parts of a country. it lasted for over 6 months and schools had to close as a result. talk about disruptive technology! that's a pretty trivial complaint expressed in a lot of words. besides helping a community is not just measured in number of jobs. how many people have used craigslist to get an apartment cheaper? how many sold stuff they wouldn't have since they couldn't afford to place an ad. how many got a better quality of item due to more selection. how many dollars exchanged hands locally rather than being diverted to ebay? his argument is that everything is now optimized and perfect and any change is bad for people. this isn't the sort of argument that has improved people's lives at any time in history. ethanol sch methanol :) negative karmas are would be very bad in scaring away new users. i found no problems using gmail with opera 8.5 and opera's own user agent identification string. as for they hype, in this case it is rather justified. unlike some of google's more lacklustre recent offerings, gmail is extremely well designed, especially in comparison to its rivals. while ajax has probably received undue attention, in the case of gmail it really does make a significant difference to user experience. news about software naturally you wouldnt give a guy negative karma if he's only submitted a couple articles. but if a guy constantly has -20 ratings on every post he submits obviously he's up to something. i'm sure the reddit guys could set it so that it's fair. i'm with mnemonic sloth. it's ridiculous to suggest that the government should enforce such a regulation. this might fly in the uk, but i don't think it'll get much support on this side of the pond. that may be a dumb question, but why should i not buy cds from sunncomm? something about this rubs me the wrong way. namely, that i can chat with someone, have their words in plaintext on my screen, and yet that person has the ability to prevent me from keeping a log. will i be able to copy and paste into a text file? or will i have to take a screenshot, run it through ocr software, and save it that way. it seems like a stupid feature and it makes complicated what should be simple. i have to wonder if they realize on a conscious level that they are undermining their industry by taking the originality out. it is a classic example of everyone for themselves. everyone is only concerned with their own profit motives, so their entire industry as a whole suffers for it. it would be in their collective best interests to enter into a bargain whereby each studio agrees to spend a certain budget on experimental movies. imagine experiencing this first hand!? astronauts have the coolest job. i have my tent gun bound to the 3key.. there was a bit of controversy in the washington d.c. area a couple years back. i don't have links, you'll have to do some research yourself. at any rate, the epa standards for safe water aren't quite what you might think. the local water company had to test houses for lead levels in the water supply. according to the regulations, as long as less than 25 of the houses had lead levels above the limit, that was ok. the kicker is that even if your house was above the limit, they didn't have to tell you that. i guess there is no substitute for getting your water supply tested in a lab. and checking the local regulations. it's your life. it has to be socially negotiated; it has to be a decision between the two chatters. they can't go off the record unless you agree too, or at least the way i'm reading it. nobody is forcing the people of burlington, vt-or wherever craigslist is-to use the service. they use it because presumably they like it better than the alternatives. if you don't like craigslist, don't use it. if you don't like starbucks or home depot, then don't go there. but if lots of other people do like these establishments, then what can you really say? i guess you can complain a lot about how people have their priorities mixed up. but you can't just force everyone to feel exactly the same way you do. christopher hitchens. even when i agree with him i hate him. me fail english? i didn't think it was mohammed. surely it's a violent protest i wonder how many people expressing the sensible view of if you don't like it, don't use it would express the same view of a walmart or whatever. i know a few commenters certainly would, but it seems like a lot of people ignore this when talking about their favorite free-market hobby horse, as if market pressure is somehow equivalent to government coercion'. what's so weird about high-contrast images sticking on the human retina if you stare at them for a while? doesn't everybody know this since childhood already? ha ha ha - tyranny of the local newspaper'. i longed for the day myself and my proletarian brothers and sisters could throw off the classified shackles of the boston globe, and glorious leader craig has delivered us from the oppression of the newsprint! viva la revolucion! that would work for me. there's no such thing as proof by precedent. in the 14th century a large number of people believed the earth was flat and was orbited by the sun. probably more appropriate on nsfw.reddit.com it must have been hard work spending those long hours on an underground sound stage. i see jesus! it's a miracle!!!! i think this cartoon really captures the whole point. people burning cars and embassies to protest a cartoon that says their wealth is violent. oh the irony. man thats so hardcore!!! i agree with the author! and i also wish the scribes hadn't lost their monopoly on the written word. if i have to listen to another newspaper man using his newspaper to cry and whine about this, i'll puke. short answer: leds are, in principle, even more monochromatic than fluorescent bulbs. i think that in this context you have to assume people are willing to pay extra for the new bulb, whether it's led or cf or something else. if so, they can get fluorescents with better phosphors and ballasts that all but eliminate the pasty white flickering light of cheap fluorescents. in the near term, the extra cost of leds is never recovered in energy savings compared to using cfl bulbs. in some cases, it's cheaper to make an led that emits uv and coat it with phosphors, than to blend a few colors of led to try and get whitelight. it is an active area of research though, and i expect we'll be switching to leds within ten years. does gtalk support transports for other im systems yet? that would be cool, all my yahoo, irc, msn logs will be saved to gmail! i don't like stories that ring alarm bells, but offer nothing to help. don't worry; this feature will be hacked in approximately 2 seconds. ;-) fans of jim morrison and fred chopin might enjoy viewing this film it shows their graves. it is a quick visual tour of the older part of paris france showing familiar and unfamiliar sites. it has the eiffel tower but also has a view up the elevator shaft to the top. this site also has a link to a site that has the movie as well a map and a list of the sites shown in the film. this film could be helpful if planning a trip to paris or just a souvenir of a previous visit. of added interest is the soundtrack which was computer composed in the style of french accordion music as still heard in the metro. if people are upset enough to care, they'll buy their coffee from other people. they might even get bored and trade in lattes for some other fad. in my town, the sbux went out of business last year and got replaced by a hookah bar. actually, the author suggests using hardware or software to remove dangerous html content from email messages and implementing firewalling on the desktop. i don't like commenters that comment without reading the story they're commenting on. no, the article says it's a myth: what happened there can more accurately be described as mass hysteria due to stress. he also points out that one person laughing more than 20 continuous minutes causes respiratory problems, making an uninterrupted 6 month laughing epidemic implausible. anyone dealing with insurance companies could use these nugget's of wisdom. insurance is not bad, you just have to leverage the system to get your full benefits the feds aren't running after them to expose user data. the feds have gotten whatever spying information they want from google. the feds just publicized one case because they thought it would help them. i don't believe that has happened, my post was in response to the original thread i tend to agree with hopper on this one. while i sympathize with those who are searching for the golden loophole in the tax code, they ignore the most important point: the law is whatever the judge says it is. what do you say to all these conspiracy theorists that ask does the moon really exist'? what must i reactivate in my web browser to see what's so funny about it? please vote this article to the top-everyone should read it. the media like experts, the more confident the better, though tetlock found that more confident means less reliable. this overconfidence is what i find most repulsive about experts.many bloggers, writing about everything from web 2.0 to personal development, fit this profile. interesting view of the current state of evolution nope, not interesting at all. this whole situation is just more evidence that religious folks suffer from a debilitating lack of humor about themselves. it must be exhausting to be so incredibly shrill. the event has been mythicized as the article says. but it is true that there was a mass hysteria that lasted for more than 6 months with symptoms that included an unusual amount of laughter. no one claimed that people laughed non-stop for 6 months. that unpossible! i think the main problem with the danish cartoons is that they were racially offensive. this has been totally mixed up with the blasphemy element by provocateurs on both sides. seriously is this the guy who runs quantumbiocommunication.com? this is a ridiculously long article, but anyone who's read the similarly bulky cryptonomicon should recognize lots of common themes, and even a few characters. enoch root has unfortunately declined to be interviewed for the article. no, the law is what the law says it is. the reason people don't do this isn't because they believe the law to be wrong, but because the irs is a very dangerous foe, and can destroy your life. they're not willing to risk it's wrath. that doesn't mean that the irs has a valid position. they're just the federal equivalent of the mafia. wow. just, wow. unfortunately i don't have any of my legos any more. i wonder if you can do the same thing with ninja turtles why not use the hide button for this functionality? well, that's true. i saw an article a few days ago about virtual card numbers; i had never heard of them before, heh. they do sound interesting and useful, but with the services offered to most consumers by most card companies, it is rather easy to not be held liable for purchases made with a stolen number. with that being said, sans a virtual number, you would probably have to get a new card number and a new card, which would be a pain. maybe virtual card numbers are more than just a niche convenience, after all wow! this is going to be great! already using gaim not sure i need another chat client sorry that was an ali g question posed to buzz. i wasn't posing it seriously. this tells me nothing i don't already know. boring. this is a podcast. comments happen within the first 5 minutes. i've seen the cartoons, and any racist angle would have to have been inferred; there's no explicit racism in them. agreed. perhaps the author feels some kind of cognitive dissonance now that he is no longer solely responsible for holding economic growth and enormous radioactive lizards in check. craigslist as a walmart for counterculture, anyone? um plans? diagrams? it's hard to build from a photo! meh. why is this amusing? excellent article re what a micro-isv needs to do in a beta and how a good beta program can jumpstart your sales. one of the key things that the author missed is that on a home system, usually the user has root access, so most of the security of having separation of privileges is lost. in os x, it is trivial for any program to get root, because all it has to do is pop up that little box that says this program is requesting system access, please enter your password which most every user does without even realizing what they are really doing is giving sudo access to the program. what a weird story. it felt made up and leaves too many questions unanswered. potentially fascinating if true. never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by clerical error. in the article larry keeley says: consumers are just not conditioned to believe that a 300 or 400 device is disposable. yeah maybe not, but when your ipod eventually dies  you've forgotten a long time ago about the pain that spending 400  causes,  there's a better model out and you feel like replacing it anyway. 33.3 nostalgia 33.3 hack 33.3 pointless; still 100 macintosh.the last attempted clinic bombing i'm aware of was on 16 sep 2004. in 2001 there were over 500 anthrax threats. the mormon war is an historical event. look it up. so now we are playing a game of whose wealth is more depraved'. well, mine only had two lynchings and and a sniper last year, so it's ok to call you uncivilized. what tripe. let go of the hate, man. recognize that you are being manipulated into thinking that peoples cannot have the same fears and; motivations as you do. their leaders are working as hard to manipulate them as this jerk jacoby is to manipulate you. a problem i have with this article is that it seems to make the assumption that everyone is rational and has perfect knowledge. it seems to me that the reason that one says something like we are running out of mathematicians and scientists and we need them is to fight the people saying, no one should be a mathematician or scientist because your job will just go to india. the purpose is to sway public opinion into thinking that these are worthwhile jobs again. there isn't any real messing with market forces. it is really just a move to get people to remember that we will always need mathematicians and scientists and there will always be jobs for them in america, regardless of india. all votes are equal. well, there you go. so now the question is: why? don't you know? that's how they can claim that israel existed as a jewish state prior to both the first use of the word palestine and the invention of being good. why not? dead link. why ask why ask why ask why? but really: because people who post things that other people like should be a better judge of what is good. thanks! other less influential users will frequently attach themselves to the growth trend of a post and drive it higher in the rankings i don't buy this. people vote for what they actually like and dislike. that's the beauty of the system. but most people tend to select posts to vote for or against only from what is already in the first few pages of the hot section. so what's hot might become hotter, but it only gets hot because of the early influencers. and the reason of shortage is government regulation, not free market. if you had free market in schools there would not be shortage in engineers. unless being a nuclear scientist is such a loose low-paid job you leave it to chinese. the central-planning approach to boosting science was tried and failed in every totalitarian country, and the same will be true in nominally free ones as well. yeah, those soviets had a really lousy science program. my contempt for the bushies is boundless. this is so hilarious. why do you still have 0 points?? yeah, where would be the world today without soviet inventions. no tvs , no pcs, no cds, no web, no ipods.. the fact that a school district has a problem is a sign that no market force will correct the problem could it be that schools are not good enough because they are public? they can artificially reward science over business when you regulate the best people from business to science you no longer have enough skilled people in business. this artificial shortage will need compensation too.. intervention is not the answer. no el viaje misterioso de nuestro homer'? one pump and here come the pirates. can you recommend a good filter? that is true, but i don't think that is what theseanald meant yeah, because ipods are clearly fundamental basic science. that's what science is for, building shiny toys. read the article. you can disable it. why does the post say indonesia? the jungle was in new guinea - the country to the east of indonesia and north of australia. they also reveal the million hectare forest covering the foja mountain range in the indonesian part of new guinea i'm guessing because the article refers to it as the indonesian part of new guinea? :-) welcome to gw bush administration. i just don't understand guido's resistance to functional parts in python. python is not purely oo, it is multi-paradigm. why he wants to kill lambda, map, reduce, filter and resists stackless python is beyond me. i think the most important point is that this is just another excuse for the iranian leadership to bring jews and the holocaust to the forefront. if they really wanted to make an equal statement, they would be requesting cartoons about jesus and moses. i always believe life is fair. you just can't have it all. i was expecting something along the lines of 30 facts about vin diesel;) the political commissar doesn't need to understand science. he knows the will of the party, and the party transcends mere science, comrade. definitely not made up. friend of mine had a very similar story. psychiatrists do worry very much about weight gain side effects. apart from not wanting to prescribe someone diabetes and heart disease, the reasoning is along the lines that being overweight will cause long-term stress and can contribute to social isolation, stress often being a major precipitating factor in these kinds of condition. regarding your citations, forgive me but i cannot connect this mentally with the topic. what has torpor of xviiith century worker's mind to do with free movement of labor and goods? your faq proposes: remuneration according to effort and sacrifice.. jobs balanced for quality of life and empowerment plus workers and consumers council democracy.. and participatory cooperative social planning rather than individualist, corporatist, competitive market exchange but afair all those ideas were thoroughly exercised in soviet union not long ago.. that's what most people expect. improvement. better quality of life. does this actually work for anyone yet? true, but even more important than that is the killer headline unfortunately i never been to us and i don't have much insight in your school system. are there any competitiveness among public schools? do you have vouchers? hilarious this article shouldn't be longer than one sentence. i couldn't be bothered to scan it for the answer. it seems that the discovery was made in the foja mountains in the eastern part of the island, which is regarded as a province of indonesia. weird! i thought this was an interesting article. i suppose i had heard that there are different types of homeless, but it seems much more useful to classify by homeless pattern than affliction. if so many people are only homeless for a day or two, it shows how much good the shelters and soup kitchens are doing. the chronic homeless are the most visible problem, and also the problem not fixed by those shelters or soup kitchens. these are the people that there is no good answer for. you don't just let them die, that doesn't fit into most people's moral code. if you keep things the way they are they keep costing so much a year. this is the first i've heard of such a solution, and it is an interesting way to think. it says in the new privacy policy that you are free to copy-and-paste it, but the official logs will not reflect any indication of off the record chatting. does this work on people who don't know or care what kind of music is playing, or regard the music as a nuisance? clerical error is the failure to report the missing armor. clerical error is the failure to let soldiers know that there is a new requirement to report the missing armor. malice is adamantly holding to an obviously broken policy: rebrook said he tried to get a battalion commander to sign a waiver on the battle armor, but the officer declined.is this real or satire? i just disagree with the idea that a word can technically be a word - or not be. the oed is strictly descriptivist: it tells you what people write and have written. someone used the word truthiness in the 1800s. that doesn't make it more of a word than if no one ever had. it doesn't make it less of one, either. the wordiness of a word can be judged by the reactions that english-speaking people have to it - particularly the english-speaking people you're using it on. truthiness probably won't stick because people will use it only for jokes. the ada voted truthiness the word of the year- not most likely to succeed', which award went to sudoku'. but it's english, after all. it's not up to me whether the word sticks around, just whether i use it. oh, i thought you were saying that people would vote for a story just to be attached to a rising one. do you think that the early influencers trend is good or bad? about 3 lbs. certainly much lighter and more effective than the article's turgid and repetitive prose. the effect is indeed seasonal, but i believe most lighting is still needed in the summer. in net, using incandescents makes your house too hot and your electric bill too high. it warm climates, you pay twice. once to overheat your house with the incandescents, then again to pump the heat out with the ac. nope, i started with raw input and switched to this. creative proposal idea. this is the story of socialized medicine. truly of socialism of any sort. you can't keep stealing from the producers and expect them to keep producing. ross jeffries tells you how to mind-hack women into sleeping with you. before that, he tells you how to mind-hack yourself into becoming somebody else, somebody who's more confident around women. hope that helps, have fun. that's because people like this guy don't pay. isn't that like saying the pricetag at a department store doesn't reflect it's actual cost? or do i misunderstand your point? i did read the story. sure, he says install a firewall, etc., then he goes on to say how hackers can easily bypass personal firewalls. what help is that? he's offering a solution that he admits doesn't work. yes. when an item at a department store gets stolen, the cost of the goods is counted as the loss, not the price of the goods. when a drunk doesn't pay a 10,000 medical bill, the cost to the hospital is not 10,000, and the government doesn't reimburse the hospital 10,000. however, there is a real cost, i've yet to find a hospital that actually knows what it is. the problem is concluding, for example, that a 5,000 a year real-costs social program is cheaper than a 25,000 a year medical bill. i don't know if it is, and i don't know if it isn't. i do know that i can't conclude that it is. :-) i still like the article, i just don't want people to think that the savings are that obvious. totally awesome stuff. ip check. i must read the slashcode admin code to check this but i'm pretty sure slashdot has been checking posts by ip address to avoid this type of problem. and if you play death metal, nobody buys any wine. paying for war equipment that's handled out of your control. this triggers a link in my brain to the story of the chinese families who have to pay for the bullet that executed their family member. it's not the same, it just triggered my link. good point but what about the non-financial opportunity costs. the patient who had to sit in the waiting room because there were no beds left or the emotional toll on the nurses who were about to quit. if someone would have stayed in a bed and paid the full 10,000 but didn't because of the homeless guy was in it then there is a financial cost as well. this is exactly why socialized medicine doesn't work. though german doctors are heading to britain, just wait. they'll all be headed over to the us soon enough. doctors are one of those little known imports that the us takes up. the pay is so much better here. health care, in my opinion, is also better here. in britain, expect to wait a few weeks for an mri. and if you have cancer, just pray. it has some pretty neat capabilities, and it's pretty cool how it uses reader macros to enable a new syntax within lisp. a good example of the power of common lisp. because it contains mismatched html tags. thanks a ton - have some karma! yeah, hospitals in the us generally are not full, so that is not really the problem.
